00:00:08,816 --> 00:00:11,120
Today, I would like to talk about Ubuntu use case on Laptops and Raspberry Pis.

2
00:00:11,376 --> 00:00:12,912
for Desktop users.

3
00:00:14,192 --> 00:00:15,728
And also I'd like to talk about how manage them.

4
00:00:17,264 --> 00:00:21,872
What are best practice, and how we should do.

5
00:00:22,128 --> 00:00:25,712
I'm Masafumi Ohta, now leading RaspberryPI User Group in Japan.

6
00:00:25,968 --> 00:00:28,784
I would love to introduce myself.

7
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:31,600
I have started RaspberryPi User Group in Japan since 2012.

8
00:00:32,624 --> 00:00:33,904
I also volunteering for RaspberryPi Foundation.

9
00:00:39,024 --> 00:00:41,072
What I am mainly doing for is

10
00:00:41,328 --> 00:00:46,192
help their business in Japan.

11
00:00:47,472 --> 00:00:52,336
Now, I'm also helping expanding the market that includes out of Japan,

12
00:00:52,592 --> 00:00:53,872
Such as China, Taiwan.

13
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:57,968
This is another self introduction
 in RaspberryPi Official Forum.

14
00:01:05,136 --> 00:01:08,720
It's hosted the "Japanese" category in the Raspberry Pi Offical forum

15
00:01:11,536 --> 00:01:13,072
You can read my post from Raspberry PI Official Site

16
00:01:14,864 --> 00:01:18,448
And please check "Japanese" category.

17
00:01:19,472 --> 00:01:23,056
I'm appreciate that if you check out.

18
00:01:23,312 --> 00:01:25,104
Here is today's agenda.

19
00:01:26,384 --> 00:01:30,420
Do you love Ubuntu Desktop? And is it useful?

20
00:01:36,624 --> 00:01:39,184
Should we preserve dualboot with Windows?

21
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,024
Hacks about UEFI and SD Cards.

22
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:45,328
And other Tips.

23
00:01:47,376 --> 00:01:49,744
Can we use Raspberry Pi as Ubuntu Desktop?

24
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,312
I'd like to introduce Raspberry Pi with Ubuntu in the last topic

25
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,360
Okay, as first,

26
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,456
Do You Love Ubuntu Desktop?

27
00:02:01,968 --> 00:02:03,760
Why I'd like to talk about,

28
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,384
Here is post by my firend in Taiwan, tha't picture in Facebook.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,012
In past,

30
00:02:15,024 --> 00:02:17,072
He, my firend, said "Freedom is Important"

31
00:02:18,352 --> 00:02:19,632
And he also declare that he don't have any needs of Microsoft Office.

32
00:02:19,888 --> 00:02:21,168
"Open Source is great."

33
00:02:21,424 --> 00:02:24,504
So he told that, "We should use Debian/GNU Linux"

34
00:02:25,264 --> 00:02:30,128
However, now, I recheck his opinion, he said that..... "macOS is best"

35
00:02:30,896 --> 00:02:32,432
And he told that, "MacBook Pro is amazing."

36
00:02:34,736 --> 00:02:36,784
From realistic viewpoint, we can't avoid this type of matter,

37
00:02:37,296 --> 00:02:39,856
When we use Ubuntu Linux as Desktop,

38
00:02:40,112 --> 00:02:44,464
we should consider that this point of view, the problem is,

39
00:02:45,744 --> 00:02:48,560
Using Ubuntu Desktop are, it is like building blocks with Lego,
we should build our own custom one-off machine

40
00:02:52,144 --> 00:02:54,448
I guess we should evaluate this point of view,

41
00:02:56,496 --> 00:02:59,240
When we use Windows, we may install apps and set some settings

42
00:02:59,264 --> 00:03:01,864
We should build our environment from Vanilla much more than Window - installing Operating System, and install many applications, describe configs...

43
00:03:02,896 --> 00:03:06,736
and many setups are needed. It's time to take many tasks.

44
00:03:06,992 --> 00:03:08,272
And more

45
00:03:08,784 --> 00:03:10,064
I guess We should take more time than expected

46
00:03:10,576 --> 00:03:12,880
using Ubuntu.

47
00:03:15,184 --> 00:03:17,232
We might meet unexpected things,

48
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:21,584
We should accept something trade-offs.

49
00:03:22,608 --> 00:03:24,912
From this viewpoint, frankly speaking,
we need patience that same as builing Logo blocks.

50
00:03:32,336 --> 00:03:35,664
It's also fun both builing and using that,
builing our own environment is great experience,

51
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,528
It's my own first prototype environment with GPD Pocket 2 (Handheld PC)

52
00:03:40,784 --> 00:03:43,344
It's Linux Desktop,

53
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,136
I installed on the SDCard,

54
00:03:48,464 --> 00:03:51,792
lately I replaced that

55
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:54,608
Here is my latest  environment,

56
00:03:56,144 --> 00:04:00,496
This is built with gpd Pocket 2 2021, minor updates

57
00:04:03,312 --> 00:04:09,200
 I have directly installed to SSD

58
00:04:13,808 --> 00:04:15,600
By the way,

59
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:19,440
There are problem that GPD Pocket got hot,
 especially bace face has high temperature.

60
00:04:19,696 --> 00:04:21,488
Because Core M3 consume electrical power and make heats.

61
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:31,983
This picture is my hack, pasted heatthink plates and cooling that.

62
00:04:36,335 --> 00:04:39,407
However, if you can accept this point, it become great gadget.

63
00:04:40,943 --> 00:04:43,503
It has extremely portable,

64
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,879
I can read e-mails and have web surfines in train,

65
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:55,279
Suspend/Resume is fast enough if you install Ubuntu into SSD.

66
00:04:55,535 --> 00:04:59,375
so I am sure that it's very useful.

67
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:07,823
Anyway, return to topic about should we preserve Windows.

68
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:14,735
I think that we have just one reason,

69
00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:21,135
if we update BIOS/UEFI with safety and easy way, we should use windows.

70
00:05:23,183 --> 00:05:25,231
GPD Pocket has windows application that can easily update BIOS/UEFI.

71
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:28,559
Just click and wait, it's easy and fast.

72
00:05:28,815 --> 00:05:34,959
We have another approach, BIOS/UEFI has built-in update interface,

73
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:37,519
we can update firmware with that interface.

74
00:05:37,775 --> 00:05:39,823
We have alternative solutions,

75
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,127
extracting from firmware archive, and getting binary

76
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,687
after that, we can update via BIOS/UEFI menu.

77
00:05:45,455 --> 00:05:48,271
And another approach is, using USB bootable OS
 and upgrade from that OS.

78
00:05:51,343 --> 00:05:55,695
Unfortunately, most safest way updating is to do with Windows.

79
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:01,839
So, we might preserve Windows.

80
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:05,167
And also, we have another reason for using Windows.

81
00:06:09,263 --> 00:06:15,407
In realistic use scnenarios, we need Zoom, Microsoft Office,
 and some Security softwares.

82
00:06:15,663 --> 00:06:21,295
And BIOS Updater, many chattools, these are firendly in Windows
 and Linux's aren't so.

83
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:33,827
In using Zoom, I should consider
about some factors, AI Camera functions

84
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,911
aren't workbale on Linux. So I must use Windows.

85
00:06:38,703 --> 00:06:44,847
That's huge gap between Linux and Windows,
 and IMHO this is vendor side issue,

86
00:06:45,103 --> 00:06:49,199
Maintenance and QA are should be provided on Windows,
it's by-design.

87
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:02,511
In this gadget, I have to talk about con

88
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:08,911
Firstly, we, linux users is too much annoyed slow speeds on SD cards because we can't use internal SSD as main storage.

89
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:21,455
And also, it's easy to corrupt,
we will see many bad sectors day by day.

90
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,807
I planed that using USB Memory but

91
00:07:26,575 --> 00:07:32,207
Performance is limited by USB port,
 it's unavoidable.

92
00:07:33,231 --> 00:07:37,583
And also it's limtited by total capacity of
 USB logical tree.

93
00:07:38,863 --> 00:07:45,007
USB Port also used to Ethernet connections,
 it consumes bandwidth and causes USB speeds down.

94
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:52,175
So, when we use some applications,

95
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:57,807
By Limited disk bandwidth, we should manage that.

96
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:02,159
And also, frankly saying, internal disk is really fast.

97
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:06,443
Here is result of benchmark,

98
00:08:06,511 --> 00:08:08,303
Both microSD card's and internal disk's,

99
00:08:10,863 --> 00:08:13,679
It's KDiskMark, CrystalDiskMark-like benchmark software

100
00:08:16,751 --> 00:08:21,615
We can get insight that random access is etremely slow.

101
00:08:25,711 --> 00:08:28,527
So we should consider how mitigate that, here.

102
00:08:31,087 --> 00:08:36,463
First, I would talk tips of using microSD,
with my experience about GPD Pocket,

103
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:36,719
I can't use suspend because Resume take many
 time and have stability issue.

104
00:08:44,143 --> 00:08:46,703
So I think that Hybernation is better using SD-Card.

105
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,663
Also I used memcache (memdisk) as cache.

106
00:08:56,175 --> 00:08:57,967
It can make virtual storage
that uses some of memory

107
00:08:58,223 --> 00:09:04,367
I am sure using virtual storage is mandatory
 for Games, Browsers, MUAs,

108
00:09:04,623 --> 00:09:06,671
because these applications
 have massive writes,

109
00:09:08,207 --> 00:09:11,023
And also these write operations
 require speed.

110
00:09:14,607 --> 00:09:17,679
So I estimated that virtual storage
 is mandatory factor.

111
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:21,263
This is tough point when using microSD.

112
00:09:23,311 --> 00:09:28,431
Okay, let's start diving deep to this.

113
00:09:28,687 --> 00:09:30,735
UEFI and SD Card hacks, with have a fun.

114
00:09:37,391 --> 00:09:39,171
These're UEFI's limitation, and...

115
00:09:39,183 --> 00:09:42,511
it may be surprised we can see many "Locked" features.

116
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:46,871
"Unlocked" gadget is rare cases,
dominant exceptional cases are gaming Laptop.

117
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:54,719
Gaming Laptop needs optimization, thus these are "Unlocked".

118
00:10:01,711 --> 00:10:06,319
Return to "Locked" cases, we can't change VT-d enablement and CPU frequency.

119
00:10:06,575 --> 00:10:10,311
Sometimes these aren't displayed and also disabled.

120
00:10:18,095 --> 00:10:20,131
Especially, disabling VT-d is critital for virtualization use cases.

121
00:10:20,143 --> 00:10:22,191
So I asked vendors about these "Locked".

122
00:10:22,447 --> 00:10:23,971
Vendors said: "It's for safety use".

123
00:10:24,527 --> 00:10:30,159
"For preventing accidents, it should be "Locked" and "not displayed"".

124
00:10:33,711 --> 00:10:37,295
In these cases, I tried to request
for getting special "Unlocked" UEFI images.

125
00:10:37,551 --> 00:10:39,343
Results are depended by-vendors,
some vendor provided that.

126
00:10:39,855 --> 00:10:41,903
In many cases, Japanese vendors
 didn't provide custom image.

127
00:10:43,183 --> 00:10:47,791
And Chinese vendors are negotiable, but it's just subjective tends.

128
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:55,215
Okay, I'd talk about SD Cards hacks.

129
00:10:57,263 --> 00:10:59,671
You might have experience of installation,

130
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,863
And if so, install to SD Card itself isn't difficult.

131
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:13,647
Difficult point is, we should consider SD Cards themselves.

132
00:11:13,903 --> 00:11:15,739
For examle, "Which vendor is better"

133
00:11:15,951 --> 00:11:21,327
Write cycle limits are per-Vendor matter.

134
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:27,983
And also you might know, in many cases, we can't use "trim" them.

135
00:11:30,031 --> 00:11:33,359
As a result, we have no way
 to reduce write cycles.

136
00:11:38,735 --> 00:11:42,831
It means that we can easily attenpt and then exceed
 write-cycles-limits of them.

137
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:49,219
Also we should know that
SD Cards are easily cause data corruptions.

138
00:11:49,243 --> 00:11:52,347
And ocaissionary the Card itself become not functional.

139
00:11:55,807 --> 00:11:59,355
So we should clarify the excess caused by broken media,
 or just data corruption.

140
00:12:05,871 --> 00:12:09,651
And also we should decide which is better,
replace SD Card, execute fsck, and more.

141
00:12:15,343 --> 00:12:21,487
Installing Windows to SD Card may be the best way if we could

142
00:12:21,743 --> 00:12:24,303
However, Windows can be only installed to internal PCIe Storage

143
00:12:27,887 --> 00:12:31,983
Due to boot ralated limiation.

144
00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:35,131
So we can't install Windows to SD Card.

145
00:12:36,847 --> 00:12:40,175
Anyway, SD Cards didn't have "trim"

146
00:12:44,015 --> 00:12:47,343
So we should consider how reduce write operations.

147
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:50,927
And also we should check data corruptions.

148
00:12:56,815 --> 00:13:00,143
Let's considering how manage when
SD Cards itself become not functional state.

149
00:13:00,911 --> 00:13:05,007
From my exeperience, dominant cases are
"becoming Read Only"

150
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,823
So first approach is "touch" command.

151
00:13:10,127 --> 00:13:12,943
touch can detect

152
00:13:13,455 --> 00:13:15,503
When you meet "Read Only" issue,

153
00:13:17,295 --> 00:13:21,391
deletion and replaces are too early, next step is...

154
00:13:21,647 --> 00:13:24,207
Boot from Live USB, and use gparted
 and execute chkdsk

155
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,679
and chkdisk may recover the issue

156
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:39,683
In many cases, we can resolve the issue
because it's special trick.

157
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:43,863
I try to explain what's happen,
it's my guess, some of SD Cards have

158
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:49,807
specific behavior.  e.g. Transcend's.
After a certain numbers of read operations,

159
00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:52,867
they will be turned to "Read Only",
as safety mechanisms.

160
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,691
And chkdsk will recover that.
After that, we can reuse SD Cards till next limit.

161
00:13:57,487 --> 00:14:00,559
These behavior are probably "By-design"
 safety mechanisms.

162
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:09,775
For controlling these behavior,
 chkdsk is first step of trouble shooting.

163
00:14:12,591 --> 00:14:17,967
And if we can't recover "Read Only" with this approach,
we should consider next step.

164
00:14:18,223 --> 00:14:22,695
Next Step is, getting new SD Cards,
and starting full copy with "dd" command.

165
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:33,839
Copying with "dd" is time consuming,
but most reliable approach.

166
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:45,103
This page has some tuning approachs to avoid
overloading to SD Cards,

167
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:49,967
Create memdisk working directory
 and using as /tmp

168
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,551
Also I created working directory with memdisk,

169
00:14:58,415 --> 00:15:03,791
and here is a Firefox tweaks,
that will use ramdisk /tmp.

170
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:13,007
For your information about SD Cards issues,
this is famous articles in Rasberry Pi.

171
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:22,775
Author is Peter Stevens,
who provides Rasbperry Pi Hosting Service, "mythic beasts"

172
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:29,899
They have great knowledge
 about SD Cards handling in real,

173
00:15:29,955 --> 00:15:35,799
In begining, they tryed hosting service
 that uses SD Cards,

174
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:41,935
And they meet many issues,
this is useful.

175
00:15:42,447 --> 00:15:48,079
And based on this knowledge, we should
understand how SD Cards are fragile.

176
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:54,523
Okay, next.

177
00:15:57,295 --> 00:16:00,879
AntiVirus softwares,

178
00:16:01,135 --> 00:16:04,207
I tested Dr.Web and ESET

179
00:16:04,671 --> 00:16:10,815
Dr. Web consumed 100% CPU in scan,
even if I used SSD.

180
00:16:15,983 --> 00:16:20,811
GPD Pocket doesn't have enough CPU power,
so we should consider that.

181
00:16:22,383 --> 00:16:28,527
For avoiding issue, scheduling
 that to idle time,

182
00:16:29,295 --> 00:16:31,487
I think scheduling is maneagable
 but bit tough.

183
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:35,439
ESET doesn't consume CPU power.

184
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:39,535
Per AntiVirus Softwares, someone consumes
machine resources.

185
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,839
So we should consider
selection with tests

186
00:16:42,607 --> 00:16:45,423
For detecting, I found
some key symptoms

187
00:16:45,935 --> 00:16:50,543
When automatic updates, I can't use apt
because Dr.Web consumes whole CPUs.

188
00:16:59,247 --> 00:17:01,295
I feel that it's not usable in my use case.

189
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:10,511
Next, Grub settings,

190
00:17:11,023 --> 00:17:17,167
In real Desktop usecase,
we should use dual boot with Windows,

191
00:17:22,287 --> 00:17:28,431
And if we erase Windows and
install ubuntu directly to internal SSD,

192
00:17:28,687 --> 00:17:31,379
It can cause issue.

193
00:17:33,551 --> 00:17:39,695
In my case, I can't boot system itself,
no boot screen, no signal.

194
00:17:39,951 --> 00:17:44,303
For solving the issue, AskUbuntu and other
articles may help you.

195
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:59,663
For Linux and Linux dual booting,
it means that you used Linux in SD Cards,

196
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,435
And plan to install another Linux
into internal storage.

197
00:18:05,807 --> 00:18:08,143
For it cases, you might
 meet another issues.

198
00:18:10,415 --> 00:18:15,095
If one updates kernel related packages,
it will re-create Grub environment.

199
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:21,423
and it can affect other side Linux

200
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:27,823
As a result, one side needs
another side for booting.

201
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:34,223
For reparing, you might need
 grub-install or boot repair tools.

202
00:18:40,879 --> 00:18:43,183
In My case, SD Card's side re-create grub,

203
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:49,583
and Grub require SD Card side's,
 so if I lost SD Card,

204
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:52,175
my GPD Pocket became unbootable.

205
00:18:57,263 --> 00:19:03,151
For fixing it, Grub menu has a way
 to select internal ssd,

206
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,527
After boot up, I re-create
Grub from internal SSD, problem gone.

207
00:19:09,551 --> 00:19:15,695
For avoiding boot issue, we should
pay attention for Grub related things.

208
00:19:17,743 --> 00:19:24,331
And here is related articles
when I met issue.

209
00:19:26,095 --> 00:19:28,475
Is Rasberry Pi useful or not?

210
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:40,799
This is Ubuntu's official page,
and we have many Raspberry Pi images.

211
00:19:42,063 --> 00:19:48,207
We have both 32-bit and 64bit
 ubuntu 21.04 images

212
00:19:49,743 --> 00:19:54,783
Ubuntu is now one of offical image. And, the images are
evaluated by engineers of Rasbperry Pi Foundation

213
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:57,203
It's appreciable point for you.

214
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:04,079
And of course these images
work well in Raspberry Pi 400 (JP)

215
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:10,611
It works in 64 bit and
 I can input with Input Method (Kana input)

216
00:20:10,635 --> 00:20:12,459
It's useful.

217
00:20:12,783 --> 00:20:16,367
Next, I'd like to provide
line up of Rasberry Pi,

218
00:20:16,623 --> 00:20:19,439
with information
 about capability of ubuntu

219
00:20:20,975 --> 00:20:24,503
Raspberry Pi3 is mainstream product
and of course Ubuntu is available.

220
00:20:25,627 --> 00:20:32,619
Raspberry Pi4, I assume that
many peoples want to use container with Ubuntu Server

221
00:20:33,263 --> 00:20:39,407
However, 8GB model is a really few stock now,
it may be improved in November.

222
00:20:41,455 --> 00:20:45,259
So please stay tuned
with 4GB Model and others.

223
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,999
And, I would recommend to use Compute Module,
I would ask you to try.

224
00:20:54,511 --> 00:20:59,459
Because it can connect many devices via PCI Express.

225
00:20:59,823 --> 00:21:05,967
And also it has HDMI and others, you can use it as Desktop via I/O board

226
00:21:07,823 --> 00:21:10,895
So let's enjoy and make some with your great idea.

227
00:21:11,151 --> 00:21:15,271
Some of users are trying to create "Hand Held" PC.

228
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:18,339
Let's try such approachs and others.

229
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:27,208
I am really sorry that Compute Module remains USB2.0 because of the resources on SoC

230
00:21:28,116 --> 00:21:31,988
And, Akkie, our community member, tested many devices

231
00:21:32,144 --> 00:21:36,496
with PCIe connectivity.

232
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,104
Notable point is, both 10GbE and NVMe work well.

233
00:21:41,752 --> 00:21:46,660
the most important point of Compute Module is,

234
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:52,368
RTC support available for it.

235
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,256
So we can build it for Embedded and Laptop.

236
00:21:58,512 --> 00:22:02,104
And you can use it as Desktop.

237
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:08,240
btw, next is Rasberry Pi 400, Pi 400 is...

238
00:22:08,752 --> 00:22:14,132
It has faster CPU and well designed heat sinks.

239
00:22:15,408 --> 00:22:19,760
also it's fanless.

240
00:22:20,016 --> 00:22:26,160
It's inspired by retro PCs, Commodore 64 and BBC Micro. Eben's hobby.

241
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:29,920
It's designed for education.

242
00:22:31,536 --> 00:22:36,452
2nd batch included some of localized versions, for Japan and India.

243
00:22:37,936 --> 00:22:43,132
localized versions for other countries will be supported but no ETAs.

244
00:22:43,388 --> 00:22:47,388
So please check Rasberry Pi official page.

245
00:22:47,412 --> 00:22:50,812
And official Twitter will provide information.

246
00:22:52,528 --> 00:22:55,308
Okay, next is roadmap,

247
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:01,744
Some of roadmaps are leaked by founder Eben in Tom's Hardware.

248
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,048
For that, fundamentally,

249
00:23:05,072 --> 00:23:09,072
We met semiconductor shortage,

250
00:23:09,072 --> 00:23:13,072
and we cannot plan 4a and 5 at right now.

251
00:23:16,616 --> 00:23:21,816
So no one can get new products untill fullfilled.

252
00:23:24,016 --> 00:23:27,600
and if you can't wait, I'd like to point what should you check,

253
00:23:27,856 --> 00:23:31,440
Return to Raspberry Pi's philosophy,  down-compatible,

254
00:23:31,696 --> 00:23:36,560
for children, and have fun, these are great hint.

255
00:23:37,072 --> 00:23:43,316
Also some of interviews and Github will have leak :)

256
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:47,964
Please check these places for getting latest information.

257
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,176
At last, I would talk "one more thing".

258
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:56,016
I have told that at many conferences,

259
00:23:56,272 --> 00:24:01,392
We're calling your Raspberry Pi project.

260
00:24:01,904 --> 00:24:03,184
What is suiting to requirement,

261
00:24:03,696 --> 00:24:08,048
We have MagPi, the official Raspberry Pi Magazine,

262
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,936
We want to introduce your project as MagPi's articles.

263
00:24:13,492 --> 00:24:16,072
There are many prospected articles in the world,

264
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:20,080
Of course, MagPi is magazine in UK, so

265
00:24:20,336 --> 00:24:24,336
So dominant are in Europe and Africa.

266
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,360
Now, bit increased China and India's

267
00:24:26,736 --> 00:24:30,576
However, it's still limited in the globe.

268
00:24:31,088 --> 00:24:32,256
So,

269
00:24:32,368 --> 00:24:46,368
We need more articles from other places, such as Korea, Taiwan, Hong-Kong, Macau, Vietnam and other places.

270
00:24:46,448 --> 00:24:52,448
We want to meet and introduce great projects from diverse areas.

271
00:24:56,432 --> 00:25:01,552
So we're appreciate that you will try / submit / contact us.

272
00:25:03,088 --> 00:25:04,112
For example,

273
00:25:04,624 --> 00:25:07,624
Here is my mediations,

274
00:25:08,464 --> 00:25:10,000
This article is provided from Taiwan,

275
00:25:10,512 --> 00:25:12,048
Maker is Penk Chen,

276
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:16,304
He provided "CutiePie".

277
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:23,400
And he works for Qt, and this handheld has rich UI.

278
00:25:28,176 --> 00:25:33,040
It bumped into editor of MagPi, and

279
00:25:33,296 --> 00:25:35,856
And he has intent to meet Penk Chen,

280
00:25:36,112 --> 00:25:41,612
So I mediate both editor and Penk Chen, result is here.

281
00:25:45,328 --> 00:25:48,912
I also introduced projects in Japan,

282
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:54,544
Here is VInyard Kikushima, Winery usecase by Mr.Kikushima.

283
00:25:55,056 --> 00:25:58,556
In this winery, he uses Raspberry Pi

284
00:25:58,652 --> 00:26:00,952
and getting many data from sensors.

285
00:26:01,044 --> 00:26:08,044
Automated system changes volume of pesticides

286
00:26:12,464 --> 00:26:14,000
What is need,

287
00:26:15,024 --> 00:26:19,120
Too many pesticides will corrupt deliciousness of wine.

288
00:26:19,376 --> 00:26:22,192
So he want to decrease them.

289
00:26:23,728 --> 00:26:26,328
However, zero pesticides isn't realistic,

290
00:26:26,364 --> 00:26:31,788
challange is, getting "lower limit" by sensors.

291
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,180
Okay, at last, it is not known exactly why, it's me.

292
00:26:36,272 --> 00:26:39,856
I have dream that I would introduce Asia-wide projects,

293
00:26:40,112 --> 00:26:42,380
not limited in Japan

294
00:26:47,496 --> 00:26:49,620
I want to introduce many projects in various area,

295
00:26:52,176 --> 00:26:54,476
I'm discussing with many open source communities,

296
00:26:54,485 --> 00:26:57,485
and providing showcases.

297
00:26:57,596 --> 00:27:01,844
Because I believe it shouldn't limit to Japan

298
00:27:02,384 --> 00:27:03,884
I have been doing so,

299
00:27:04,944 --> 00:27:11,944
China, Taiwan, Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand.....and others,

300
00:27:12,112 --> 00:27:18,000
I want to see many projects from many area.

301
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,760
So if you want to introduce your project.

302
00:27:20,816 --> 00:27:26,424
Please feel free to reach out to me.

303
00:27:30,032 --> 00:27:31,312
As conclusion,

304
00:27:34,384 --> 00:27:40,056
Using Ubuntu Desktop is fun, but it likes Lego.

305
00:27:40,272 --> 00:27:45,272
We should never forget it,

306
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:48,852
You should pay some time, not easy way.

307
00:27:48,976 --> 00:27:52,476
If it's not feasible for usecase,

308
00:27:52,548 --> 00:27:56,388
We should install to SD Card and use as sub desktop.

309
00:27:56,444 --> 00:27:59,180
and use Windows as primary.

310
00:27:59,216 --> 00:28:02,032
I would like to reiterate that.

311
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:08,504
And we should review Pros/Cons of
Internal SSD and microSD.

312
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:12,728
Considering trade-off is mandatory.

313
00:28:13,552 --> 00:28:21,152
And also, we should understant that
 how SD Card works as boot device.

314
00:28:23,792 --> 00:28:32,556
And, For Rasbberry Pi, Ubuntu is official and 64bit.

315
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:41,200
Raspberry Pi OS 64 bit is currently trial phase.

316
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,600
64 bit suse is already official phase.

317
00:28:47,856 --> 00:28:54,856
AFAIK, only suse and Ubuntu
are official phase with 64 bit support.

318
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:04,560
And if you have great project,
 absolutely, please keep in touch with me.

319
00:29:05,008 --> 00:29:14,008
Mail, Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin,
and other approaches are welcome.

320
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,060
Please let me know with any contacts.

321
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,952
Thank you for your time.

322
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,512
okay, just 30 minutes.

323
00:29:27,024 --> 00:29:32,024
Have a nice day! See you all.
