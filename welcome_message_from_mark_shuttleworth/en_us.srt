00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:12,560
Hello, my name is Mark Shuttleworth and I am 
delighted to welcome you to UbuCon Asia.   

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:19,440
Now one of the big dreams of Open Source is that it 
would level the playing field that entrepreneurs,  

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,800
innovators, and everyday people whichever no 
matter what country they are in, no matter  

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:34,474
what their personal circumstances, all have access 
equally to the greatest technology that humanity can create. 

5
00:00:34,474 --> 00:00:41,280
And we have seen over the last few 
decades Open Source become a tremendous leveler.  

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,080
You don't have to be in Silicon Valley to create 
the next great startup. You don't have to be  

7
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:52,640
wealthy to get access to sophisticated software 
to invent the future or just to participate  

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,440
in digital culture. So it's an incredible 
privilege for those of us who work in Open Source  

9
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:06,000
to know that all around the world, people 
just like you are able to enjoy Open Source,  

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,160
appreciate Open Source, and contribute 
to Open Source and use Open Source  

11
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:17,280
to build great things for themselves and for the 
people around them. Open Source is a great leveler  

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,840
and it touches every industry. Just in our own 
work at Canonical we work with telecommunications  

13
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,160
companies, telcos changing the nature of 
bandwidth to the home, bandwidth to businesses,  

14
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,160
telecommunications services. The automotive 
industry, there is Open Source in cars, there is  

15
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,600
Open Source in factories, there's Open Source in 
the robots that make the cars, there's Open Source  

16
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:50,320
in the clouds that have all the data that make 
cars autonomous, there's Open Source in the high  

17
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,480
performance computing that essentially simulates 
cars to make them safer. Open Source is changing  

18
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:05,120
every industry from finance to smart cities to 
smart homes. I hope that the UbuCon Asia agenda  

19
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:10,320
will be your gateway to Open Source whatever your 
ambitions, whatever your dreams, whatever your  

20
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,280
technology future. I hope that Open Source will 
be at the heart of it, and that this conference  

21
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,840
can be a meaningful step for you to that future. I 
want to thank the organizers. It takes an enormous  

22
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,240
amount of work to pull together different 
people, pull together program, get people  

23
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,760
prepared to speak, and then to make everybody 
aware of it. I hope you have a great time. Thank  

24
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,240
you for your interest in Ubuntu. Thank you to 
those of you who are members of the community  

25
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:49,840
and contributors to Ubuntu. It is your work that 
makes Ubuntu great. Have a great conference.
