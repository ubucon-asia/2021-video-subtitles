Assalamu'alaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh.

2
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:12,661
I am Faiq Aminuddin.

3
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:16,358
Headmaster of Islamic Junior High School NU ITB Tedunan Wedung Demak.

4
00:00:16,358 --> 00:00:23,425
I am an Ubuntu and BlankOn Linux user.

5
00:00:23,425 --> 00:00:25,375
Please let us share

6
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:33,783
about Pegon script typing using a computer installed with Ubuntu.

7
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:36,058
What is Pegon?

8
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:42,882
Pegon is an Hijaiyah Arabic alphabet used to write Nusantara letter of alphabet

9
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:49,341
like Javanese, Sundanese, or Bahasa Indonesia itself.

10
00:00:51,169 --> 00:00:59,780
There are some letter such as letter P, C, G, NG, NY

11
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:07,863
That cannot be representated correctly if written with genuine Hijaiyah Arabic alphabet.

12
00:01:07,863 --> 00:01:15,215
Therefore it needs some adjustments, so it is comes up with Pegon script.

13
00:01:15,215 --> 00:01:26,345
Even though a part of Pegon script letters can be found on Arabic Unicode list.

14
00:01:27,604 --> 00:01:29,189
Therefore,

15
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:36,663
at one of the sessions at Gnome Asia Summit in Gresik in 2019,

16
00:01:36,744 --> 00:01:45,640
Mr. Aftian ever invites us to made a file that contains Pegon script keyboard layout

17
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:50,717
then named as .jv

18
00:01:50,839 --> 00:02:00,709
then saved in usr/share/x11/xkb/symbol folder.

19
00:02:00,994 --> 00:02:12,205
With this Mr. Aftian way, computer users can type Pegon script easily according to the desired keyboard layouts.

20
00:02:12,774 --> 00:02:15,292
However,

21
00:02:15,413 --> 00:02:21,750
that way will be slightly difficult for common users.

22
00:02:25,203 --> 00:02:30,118
Pada Ubuntu 20, saya malah menemukan file jv.
On Ubuntu 20, I even found .jv file.

23
00:02:30,118 --> 00:02:35,683
Unfortunately, that .jv file does not contained Pegon script keyboard layout.

24
00:02:35,724 --> 00:02:42,304
but contained Javanese script layout, Hanacaraka.

25
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:52,012
So, the .jv file cannot be used anymore for Pegon script.

26
00:02:52,012 --> 00:02:54,409
So it needs another name.

27
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:58,186
As for in our school,

28
00:02:58,633 --> 00:03:02,492
In Islamic Junior High School NU ITB 

29
00:03:02,492 --> 00:03:11,347
Majority of us still unfamiliar with keyboard layouts other that is commonly used namely English (en/US).

30
00:03:13,216 --> 00:03:18,943
then, the solution we ever tried is to utilize on-screen keyboard.

31
00:03:21,055 --> 00:03:32,429
On this on-screen we can see that actually several Pegon script letters already on Arabic keyboard.

32
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:37,628
But we still having trouble using it.

33
00:03:38,481 --> 00:03:43,477
So, we tried to use another Virtual Keyboard;

34
00:03:45,061 --> 00:03:47,620
that is by installing Onboard application.

35
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:56,313
On that Onboard application we can type more Pegon script

36
00:03:56,882 --> 00:04:01,878
such as C, P, NG, and NY letters.

37
00:04:02,975 --> 00:04:10,530
So, there are 5 Pogon script letters that can we used

38
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,633
that is by activating Alt-Gr button.

39
00:04:14,673 --> 00:04:23,202
Even though it is not completed yet (G letters not existed on Onboard), this is still very good.

40
00:04:24,991 --> 00:04:38,314
Another alternative is: sometimes we have to type Pegon sript with genuine Hijaiyah Arabic alphabet.

41
00:04:39,695 --> 00:04:43,838
For examples, P letter typed with Fa' (ف) letter

42
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:48,834
NG letter typed with Ain (ع) letter.

43
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:52,856
This way, of course it is not an ideal way.

44
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,902
Therefore, we hope that:

45
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:05,854
1. Pegon script keyboard is embedded on Gnome and Ubuntu

46
00:05:05,935 --> 00:05:14,222
so that common users like us in the school just used it anyway.

47
00:05:14,425 --> 00:05:21,858
2. On-screen keyboard can be used to type Pegon script

48
00:05:21,858 --> 00:05:24,742
That is all from us

49
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:26,692
Wassalamu'alaikum Warahmatullah Wabarakatuh.
