00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,834
Hi, everyone in the Ubuntu community.

2
00:00:10,867 --> 00:00:13,200
 First of all, I am very grateful to UbuCon ASIA 

3
00:00:13,234 --> 00:00:15,700
for providing this opportunity for me to communicate with everyone

4
00:00:15,734 --> 00:00:17,534
Today I want to share with you

5
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:21,500
 all the efforts that the openEuler community has made in the open source compliance area.

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,767
 I hope that I can collide spark with everyone more.

7
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:29,634
OpenEuler community was born at the end of 2019

8
00:00:29,634 --> 00:00:32,280
and is currently the largest,

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,466
 most active and transparent operating system open source community in China.

10
00:00:35,466 --> 00:00:40,693
.A total of three releases have been issued since the first version was released in March 2020,

11
00:00:40,693 --> 00:00:44,689
and more than 6,000 community contributors have participated in.

12
00:00:44,689 --> 00:00:46,481
Kylin software I work for

13
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:49,423
is the second largest contributor to the OpenEuler community.

14
00:00:49,423 --> 00:00:53,340
Open source compliance is a very big topic,

15
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,067
including but not limited to copyright and license compliance

16
00:00:57,067 --> 00:00:59,569
 patent compliance, export control compliance,

17
00:00:59,569 --> 00:01:02,034
 GDPR compliance, trade secret compliance

18
00:01:02,034 --> 00:01:03,625
and trademark compliance, etc.

19
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:06,932
open source compliance is also a breakthrough to encourage developers

20
00:01:06,932 --> 00:01:10,273
to understand the open source culture and join the open source community.

21
00:01:10,273 --> 00:01:16,035
OpenEuler community has placed great emphasis on open source compliance since its creation

22
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:17,715
With the rapid development of the community,

23
00:01:17,715 --> 00:01:21,486
a special compliance sig was established in January 2021.

24
00:01:21,486 --> 00:01:23,069
The main work content includes

25
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:26,033
 research and science popularization in compliance-related fields,

26
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:28,845
analysis and answers to community compliance problems,

27
00:01:28,845 --> 00:01:34,485
and development and maintenance of the access control system when submitting community contributions.

28
00:01:34,485 --> 00:01:41,217
response to the most core license recognition management work in the open source community governance work,

29
00:01:41,217 --> 00:01:44,557
the compliance sig has designed and planned a complete set of compliance tool chains,

30
00:01:44,557 --> 00:01:48,008
and is now steadily advancing the implementation according to the roadmap.

31
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:50,982
Combining the specific functions of the various link tools,

32
00:01:50,982 --> 00:01:56,376
the compliant sig partners named them after the names of famous people in the ancient Chinese Three Kingdoms period.

33
00:01:56,376 --> 00:02:00,757
Every fan of the Three Kingdoms will smile when they hear their names.

34
00:02:00,757 --> 00:02:05,458
Next, I will explain the complete operation process of the entire tool chain for everyone.

35
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,334
When the community receives a new pr,

36
00:02:08,334 --> 00:02:13,832
we first ask the Cao Chong tool to classify the submitted content into code or non-code

37
00:02:13,832 --> 00:02:16,612
such as documents, multimedia， rich text, etc.

38
00:02:16,612 --> 00:02:19,943
Text documents can be directly scanned for their license information,

39
00:02:19,943 --> 00:02:24,594
 while code types need to be used Huatuo Code Kinship Analysis tool analyzes its kinship 

40
00:02:24,594 --> 00:02:29,093
 and scans for fragment references of existing open source software source codes.

41
00:02:29,093 --> 00:02:33,758
.If there is a reference, confirm whether it complies with the corresponding license.

42
00:02:33,758 --> 00:02:35,758
If there is no license, manual judgment is required to determine whether there is plagiarism.

43
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,200
Because of the severe conditions of this stage,

44
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,198
the tool was named Zhang Fei, a man who is the gateway, ten thousand men cannot open.

45
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,200
After Zhang Fei Gatekeeper access control is passed,

46
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,958
a standard license text comparison is required to confirm 

47
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:55,510
 that it is the standard version of the license text or a variant license modified by the developer.

48
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,520
For all the licenses involved in the project, 

49
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,835
uniformly check the SPDX standard format, 

50
00:03:02,835 --> 00:03:08,113
and then confirm whether each license has passed the OSI or FSF certification.

51
00:03:08,113 --> 00:03:12,441
.If it is not OSI or FSF certified license,

52
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:14,418
a community decision is required.

53
00:03:14,418 --> 00:03:16,088
whether to agree to the merge.

54
00:03:16,088 --> 00:03:22,062
Next, the Diao Chan system will determine whether the labels of different licenses are compatible or conflicting.

55
00:03:22,062 --> 00:03:25,789
 the compliance risk analysis report of the entire project is formed

56
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:29,340
and output to the SBOM risk warning board and archived.

57
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:37,695
Developers and reviewers can check the compliance risk summary of the entire project through the SBOM risk pre-warning board

58
00:03:37,695 --> 00:03:43,572
 and at the same time can open a detailed examination of the project’s explicit and implicit dependencies,

59
00:03:43,572 --> 00:03:47,582
and confirm whether the omissions are in the abrupt license.

60
00:03:47,582 --> 00:03:53,098
.The name of the Diao Chan system Diao Chan is one of the four great beauties in ancient China.

61
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:59,133
 With a friendly human-computer interface, the system summarizes boring legal texts into three types of

62
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:07,885
 labels for rights, obligations and restrictions for users to quickly identify and understand various common licenses.

63
00:04:07,885 --> 00:04:13,776
The Diao Chan system also provides an API interface for the access control system or a third party to use.

64
00:04:13,776 --> 00:04:21,207
Developers can use the GraphQL API provided by the Diao Chan system to conveniently confirm the interface information.

65
00:04:21,207 --> 00:04:26,747
At present, we have mainly completed the development of the Diaochan system and Huatuo tools.

66
00:04:26,747 --> 00:04:29,560
Zhangfei Gatekeeper has also been put into trial operation,

67
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,558
and there are still many tasks waiting for us.

68
00:04:32,558 --> 00:04:37,033
The current entire compliance tool chain considers common problems in license compliance work,

69
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:39,413
such as  whether to declare a license,

70
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:41,495
whether the license text is standard,

71
00:04:41,495 --> 00:04:46,241
and whether the license used has been certified by OSI or FSF,

72
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:48,926
is the license in the project fully compatible 

73
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:53,977
there is still a huge room for improvement

74
00:04:53,977 --> 00:04:58,604
 I hope that friends in the Ubuntu community will share your valuable opinions with us.

75
00:04:58,604 --> 00:05:01,514
Thank you all, goodbye!
