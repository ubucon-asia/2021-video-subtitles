00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,034
Hello

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,034
In today's session

3
00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:18,367
We'd talk a little bit about how Ubuntu is being provided in various cloud environments.

4
00:00:18,367 --> 00:00:25,034
We are Junhyun Bae of Cloud Mate, Sejun Kim. It's nice to meet you (nice to meet you)

5
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:31,640
Here, it's a topic we're going to talk about today

6
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,700
Can you explain about it briefly?

7
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,367
You pass it like that(laughs)

8
00:00:38,367 --> 00:00:41,034
It's giving or receiving, and it's in English

9
00:00:41,034 --> 00:00:49,034
We are a cloud service provider, and we provide services to cloud to cloud venders.

10
00:00:49,034 --> 00:00:58,066
And we consult users no matter they are on AWS, Azure or Google.

11
00:00:58,066 --> 00:01:02,034
Now, what we want to focus on here is that when we're using Linux,

12
00:01:02,034 --> 00:01:08,529
Ubuntu deliverd by Canonical is the most being supported operating system supported by the 3 companies.

13
00:01:08,529 --> 00:01:13,400
So, each vendor is now focusing on different operating systems, but

14
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:23,553
For Canonical's Ubuntu which all three provide in common, we are explaining a little more detail what kind of service the vendor provides and how does it deliverd.

15
00:01:23,553 --> 00:01:30,034
As you said, now let's find out how Ubuntu is being provided by three famous companies in the cloud.

16
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,168
First of all, oh, we didn't introduce ourselves before that.

17
00:01:34,168 --> 00:01:41,034
To introduce myself, I'm Bae Junhyun, and I'm currently the head of the Seoul branch of Ubuntu Korean Commnnity.

18
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:47,700
And I work as an Azure MVP at Microsoft and work on DevOps.

19
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,767
Yes, I operate a community called Smart Azure Living in Korea

20
00:01:52,767 --> 00:01:58,034
I also work as an Azure MVP and I work as a cloud architect.

21
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:03,700
Then, let's talk about Azure, which we are a bit confident of among the three cloud companies.

22
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,534
In the case of Azure, the logo has changed a bit recently. The logo has changed, and

23
00:02:07,534 --> 00:02:13,367
we do not need to find Ubuntu to use Ubuntu on Azure now, we are now

24
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:16,700
providing the latest LTS version of Ubuntu as

25
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:22,034
it is, 'Create a resource', as you can see when we create a virtual machine.

26
00:02:22,034 --> 00:02:26,034
It provides the version corresponding to 'focal fossa' as it is.

27
00:02:26,034 --> 00:02:32,700
Sometimes, there's some people who want to use a different version of the image, who want to use a lower image to be more stable.

28
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,700
So, if you want to use a lower version, you can create a virtual machine like

29
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,367
let's enlarge this guy

30
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:43,034
You can use the lower version such as 'bionic beaver' or

31
00:02:43,034 --> 00:02:48,700
you can also use the Linux other versions as we can see.

32
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,700
In addition, when you want to get some support from Canonical

33
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:00,034
you can search for Canonical on the Marketplace to find various versions, and

34
00:03:00,034 --> 00:03:03,700
in the case of this guy, a bit of price should be charged.

35
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:12,033
If you want to check the Pro licenses that are now fully serviced by Canonical, you should search for Canonical on the Marketplace.

36
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:16,033
Yes, and there's a 'reserved instance'

37
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:21,033
Which can be reserved Canonical delivering instances for 1~3 years

38
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:27,560
then you can also get some discount option about 15% for these reservations.

39
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:34,033
In the case of Azure, most of the backend technologies are very well connected with Canonical (Yes, it is)

40
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:43,033
It differ by the each cloud company, though you should regard Azure is being supporeted as Debian or Ubuntu like.

41
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:48,367
So even if you run Cloud Shell, there is now another operating system for Ubuntu.

42
00:03:49,033 --> 00:03:51,033
Next, it's AWS

43
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:57,033
Now, if you scroll down a bit on the first screen when you create an actual instance

44
00:03:57,033 --> 00:04:01,033
it now supports Ubuntu Server

45
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:04,033
and it supports 64-bit or ARM

46
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:08,033
it supports x86 and ARM of 64-bit.

47
00:04:09,145 --> 00:04:16,367
And there's another license for these servers when you search for it

48
00:04:16,367 --> 00:04:21,700
and here you see 62% saving in order to get a 62% saving

49
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:29,033
you have to sign to 'you must keep to use about 1~3 years'.

50
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:34,690
In case of AWS, when you installed such Azamzon Linux, bacially

51
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,700
the package manager is a Debian familly, it actually provides Fedora familly

52
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,033
In case of Azure, it provides the Debian family

53
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,033
Lastly, here is Google

54
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:49,216
In case of Google, uh, it was a bit unique.

55
00:04:49,216 --> 00:04:52,700
First of all, the Google console itself is rather simple.

56
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:59,040
It's simple, but as we saw earlier, you can still get a Pro license

57
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,867
and it offers all of the same existing LTSs.

58
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:10,367
What differs in GCP is that you can see the lastest is deployed here

59
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:19,033
Usually, they only provide LTSs, and the other 2 companies still don't support 21.04,

60
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:27,033
while here, it support 'hirsute hippo' the 21.04.

61
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:29,367
In 21.04, the kernel version has been changed.

62
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:37,033
In the 20.04, the 5.4 kernel was used, but if you want to use the 5.11 kernel, you can choose it.

63
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:45,533
Finally, we, Cloudmate structs and operate the real services for the member companies.

64
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:50,700
and, some of you who use cloud, Wherever for you are using in,

65
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,033
if you use Linux, we recommond you to use Ubuntu

66
00:05:54,033 --> 00:06:01,033
and we highly encourage you to operate as same configurations and same environments.

67
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:03,700
and it would be good to play with us for clouds.

68
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:06,033
Yes, this was our explanation.

69
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:08,367
Nice to meet you. Oh, it's not 'nice to meet you'.

70
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:14,033
Yes, thank you. It's been Cloudmate.
