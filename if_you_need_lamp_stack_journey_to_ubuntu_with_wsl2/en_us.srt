00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,034
Ok, Hello!

2
00:00:10,034 --> 00:00:13,920
This is Byung-seung Cho from the Ubuntu Korean Community.

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:27,034
From now on, Let's get started with Ubucon Asia 2021 Lightning Talk session, 'If you need LAMP Stack, Journey to Ubuntu with WSL2'

4
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:35,834
What I wanted to build with Ubuntu on WSL was just a simple WordPress site.

5
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:42,034
I will introduce the basic stack what I used for the WordPree site, first.

6
00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:49,934
First, LAMP Stack which I choosed was putting a nginx web server on Ubuntu OS,

7
00:00:49,934 --> 00:00:53,034
Maria DB for database, and PHP

8
00:00:53,034 --> 00:00:58,000
That was basic configuration that I selected for WordPress requirements.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,367
Although I'll use it in live server,

10
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:06,700
I wanted to work more comfortably locally before the deployment, 

11
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,500
but since I am a Windows user,

12
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:22,034
'How can I make an environment closer to the server more comfortable to use on my laptop?' struck me, first.

13
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:27,667
So now, Virtualbox, or VM Ware, etc.

14
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:35,200
Now, later, I use Multi-pass together, anyway, WSL2 was most convenient for them,

15
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,034
in simple task.

16
00:01:37,034 --> 00:01:39,034
I want to tell that point.

17
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,334
The contents coming later are not about 'How to use Ubuntu with WSL2', but

18
00:01:44,334 --> 00:01:49,800
there will be some troubleshooting tips in my experience such as the installation.

19
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,630
So I'm going to share it briefly.

20
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,034
Here are two tips that you should never miss.

21
00:01:59,034 --> 00:02:07,034
One is that you can insert and remove files directly from Windows Explorer to Ubuntu in WSL.

22
00:02:07,034 --> 00:02:10,367
This address can now be used comfortably.

23
00:02:10,367 --> 00:02:22,034
Next, if you just type the code, file name, and just that folder in WSL, the Visual Studio Code editor runs immediately.

24
00:02:22,034 --> 00:02:32,700
Visual Studio Code itself is installed on Windows, so you can easily change the header file or change the CSS for a while, so

25
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:43,034
these two are literally tips that are like a quick guide. So, if you know this you can easily fix it quickly for a long time.

26
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:51,034
When trying to use WSL2, the Windows 10 version must be checked first.

27
00:02:51,034 --> 00:02:54,600
Well, if you're using the preview version of Windows 11 right now, it doesn't matter at all.

28
00:02:54,634 --> 00:02:59,534
However, when it's 10, you should pay attention to third line more then anyting else.

29
00:02:59,534 --> 00:03:06,534
When you check the OS build, it has the 5 then 3 or 4 digits, and they are usually correct.

30
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:08,700
You just need to pull all latest updates.

31
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:17,034
But this last part has to be more than 1049 now, but sometimes it's three digits.

32
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:23,034
If these are three digits, WSL2 will never be activated even if the rest of the conditions are met.

33
00:03:23,034 --> 00:03:31,400
So, the biggest obstacle to its activation is that part, so please don't forget and take care of it.

34
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:41,767
Yes, in the beginning I said that we can send and receive files directly from Windows Explorer to directories in Ubuntu, but there is reverse direction way.

35
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:49,167
It means, if you look at Ubuntu, you can enter directly from the mount directory as a Windows local drive like this.

36
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,067
Even if you do that, it doesn't matter anyway.

37
00:03:52,067 --> 00:04:00,700
However, in the initial state attached like that, chmod or chown cannot be executed anymore.

38
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,567
Running it doesn't change permissions or settings.

39
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:12,367
To change that, first, you should unmount the mounted drive itself from Ubuntu.

40
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:22,367
Then, when remounting after unmounting is finished, you should mount it again with the metadata value and the setting value

41
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:29,034
then, itself would be setted up to orchestrate configurations such as user permissions.

42
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:33,867
You can it in this way, so this setting would be much more convenient than you think.

43
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:37,100
There are times when it is annoying to run Windows Explorer inside Ubuntu as well.

44
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,934
Or, accessing to fold through the network can also be annoying.

45
00:04:41,934 --> 00:04:45,167
So, it would be good to know this as well.

46
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,667
Then, the following may be a habit only I have.

47
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:59,467
Originally, when I was using IaaS in AWS, Azure, or cloud like this, when server goes wrong,

48
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:04,467
Terminated it, and created a new one, I just repeated this routine.

49
00:05:04,467 --> 00:05:08,867
However, I used it in WSL2 as it is, however

50
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:13,867
when it come to 'The setting went wrong but it's annoying to revert it', its installation is simple, so

51
00:05:13,867 --> 00:05:18,367
I just went to the MS store again and press Install Ubuntu and continue to use Ubuntu like this.

52
00:05:19,034 --> 00:05:21,534
As I kept to use like this, I kept repeating the reinstallation.

53
00:05:22,034 --> 00:05:25,034
If you continue to reinstall 10 or 20 times, more and more,

54
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:31,334
then, MS store showed me an error, even though I obviously deleted Ubuntu cleanly.

55
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,400
So the installation does not proceed.

56
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,700
In this case, there is a way to fix it by reboot.

57
00:05:38,814 --> 00:05:42,367
But even after reboot, there are times when it doesn't work again.

58
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:50,634
In that case, instead of Ubuntu, you should go to the MS Store to initialize the app data from MS Store, and now

59
00:05:50,634 --> 00:05:53,534
you can install it without any problems.

60
00:05:53,634 --> 00:06:00,034
This is 'why can't I install it, Is WSL2 Wrong? What's wrong?' Don't get confused like this.

61
00:06:00,034 --> 00:06:03,034
Yes, I searched this tip for it.

62
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:15,634
Then, there is several things to do in your local WSL2(and also WSL1) after reboot.

63
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:16,867
What we're doing is,

64
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:20,934
ah well, what I'm doing is the LAMP Stack, so

65
00:06:20,934 --> 00:06:29,867
originally I thought that the status would be always in 'running', but whenever I reboot, it was always off.

66
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:41,034
So, at that time, I always run the command and shell and just type 'wsl sudo service nginx start' in the command window to eat it right away.

67
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:48,034
So, after rebooting, you must always set this up to use the homepage.

68
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:50,100
Eh, it might look like this.

69
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:57,700
If you don't do this, you're just like, 'Oh, I can't connect after a reboot, I can't go to the homepage' It is just not working, in that moments.

70
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:06,034
So it's because the server isn't up, so you should check whether the server is running at that time.

71
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,830
With a series of tips, I've done my setting.

72
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:16,034
After adjusting the settings, I was able to see the WordPress view.

73
00:07:16,034 --> 00:07:19,434
When view is available, is it really the end now?

74
00:07:19,434 --> 00:07:27,034
For now, It's not a matter of using WSL2 anymore, but creating a website itself is not the end, is it?

75
00:07:27,034 --> 00:07:34,367
So even after that, in fact, I have to upload more theme settings and other settings on the homepage.

76
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,534
Yes, I have to start a new journey again.

77
00:07:37,534 --> 00:07:47,400
However, thanks to WSL2, I was unfamiliar with the various settings, but I was able to go through more famillar, so

78
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:53,240
I was able to create a manual, and yes, I was able to come easily.

79
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,367
It's a short lightning talk, so rather than explaining this in detail,

80
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:01,900
in fact, I don't know this technically in so much detail.

81
00:08:02,034 --> 00:08:09,034
Though, I hope the tips I picked up would be good help for you.

82
00:08:09,034 --> 00:08:16,167
If you have any feedback or other questions after this video, please post a question on the

83
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:22,034
Facebook channel, or through the Korean Ubuntu users group. 

84
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:27,034
Then, I'll answer as best as I can.

85
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:29,767
Yes, this concludes the Lightning Talk.

86
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:31,767
Thank you!
