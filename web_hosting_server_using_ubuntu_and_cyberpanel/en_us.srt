00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,600
Hello everyone, Good morning and greetings to all.

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:25,500
Today I'm gonna talk about Web Hosting Server using Ubuntu and Cyberpanel

3
00:00:30,172 --> 00:00:34,400
But let me introduce myself first. My name is Darian Rizaludin

4
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,700
Bussiness development at Radnet Digital Indonesia

5
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:45,193
I'm in the web and hosting division

6
00:00:45,193 --> 00:00:56,483
So I often doing things related to Linux administration servers and network

7
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:10,300
Let's start with Cyberpanel first.

8
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:16,300
Cyberpanel is a control panel of OpenLiteSpeed...

9
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:22,600
that you can manage your websites, install Wordpress and more

10
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:31,500
Actually, you don't need Cyberpanel to install Wordpress...

11
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,800
over OpenLiteSpeed

12
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,800
but with this Cyberpanel, you can do so much things with one click like

13
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,700
install WordPress and then

14
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:52,000
set up SSL, make many other webistes,

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,300
change PHP version up to version 8 and also

16
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:06,100
using the File Manager which is built-in feature in Cyberpanel.

17
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,100
I simply recommend this for those who want

18
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:20,371
to keep it easy and simple.

19
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:26,100
What is OpenLiteSpeed then?

20
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:39,200
It is one of the fastest web server.

21
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,121
You don't need to be confused of the differences between OpenLiteSpeed and Lite Speed.

22
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:51,231
All have the same function

23
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:57,400
and it's open source too.

24
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,200
So you can install OpenLiteSpeed on a vps server

25
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,500
that is running on Ubuntu 20.04 or on

26
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,200
CentOS 8

27
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:20,900
So when you install the Cyberpanel on a vps,

28
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:27,000
there will be a web interface to control OpenLiteSpeed

29
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:45,127
There is also a plugin in Cyberpanel called LSCache.

30
00:03:45,127 --> 00:03:50,000
It is actually a built in OpenLiteSpeed cache solution.

31
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:59,100
It also runs with Apache and NginX server

32
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:06,000
but some features can only run on OpenLiteSpeed server

33
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,900
Now, let's just go ahead. What do you need to prepare

34
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:25,600
when installing this Cyberpanel.

35
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:33,652
I have prepared a vps when I writing this slides.

36
00:04:33,652 --> 00:04:36,500
So most of them are in default settings.

37
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:43,000
We use the port 22 for SSH.

38
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,800
Now we can access the vps and use it to install.

39
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,900
You can use terminal on Ubuntu or

40
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:59,500
here I give an example using PuTTY

41
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:07,000
Just access it using user root

42
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,200
then the IP address.

43
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:29,200
This is how it looks when you have successfully connect with SSH.

44
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:35,141
I am using Ubuntu 20.04.2.

45
00:05:50,085 --> 00:05:59,479
This is the first command we need to type to install Cyberpanel

46
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:07,000
just type this comment and used on ssh that already connect

47
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,200
earlier so we first remotely to SSH using

48
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:22,100
Terminal or PuTTY

49
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:27,700
If it successful then type this here too

50
00:06:47,700 --> 00:07:00,000
We just need to follow these steps

51
00:07:30,606 --> 00:07:32,316
If installation is success

52
00:07:32,316 --> 00:07:39,500
we will get info like this

53
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:52,900
visit https://your server's IP and use the port 8090

54
00:07:52,900 --> 00:08:06,129
It'll also show panel username, panel password, mysql username and mysql password

55
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:28,300
We can update the Cyberpanel and the OpenLiteSpeed

56
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,100
Here is a command to upgrade the version

57
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:37,800
using the stable OpenLiteSpeed (v1.6)

58
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:44,800
You can upgrade both

59
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,200
by using the following command like this command

60
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:57,600
This is a command that is used to upgrade

61
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,100
Cyberpanel and OpenLiteSpeed. Just copy this and

62
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:09,200
paste to your terminal, and you will be able

63
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:19,300
to update the Cyberpanel and OpenLiteSpeed

64
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:28,500
There is also other ways to update OpenLiteSpeed

65
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:34,505
to the most recent stable version.

66
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:37,785
Type "apt-get update" first and

67
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:41,000
then apt-get upgrade.

68
00:09:41,469 --> 00:09:52,982
Or we can download with other way (tar.gz)

69
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:12,209
After download using wget, we can extract and then move it its folder and install.

70
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,400
So the first command will update the package automatically

71
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:29,300
and the second one for update it manually

72
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,000
via package that available on the openlitespeed website,

73
00:10:55,387 --> 00:10:59,845
I will give an example about how to 

74
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,700
install a website in Cyberpanel

75
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:12,900
I'll use WordPress for a simple example.

76
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:24,600
First we have to point to the available DNS records

77
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:34,600
In my case, I'm using digital ocean for the vps

78
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:49,500
I pointing my domain to the digitalocean's public IP.

79
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:57,600
After successfully pointing the domain, then access the Cyberpanel

80
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:08,900
by accessing the http://IP address plus

81
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:14,400
port 8090. Just like that.

82
00:12:20,883 --> 00:12:28,000
Well this is his cyberpanel login view.

83
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,700
Type the username and the password.

84
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:40,900
If we forget the Cyberpanel password

85
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:46,400
We can use command

86
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:53,525
sudo cat .litespeed_password

87
00:12:55,448 --> 00:12:59,148
Here we can see the stored username and password

88
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:10,400
You can use that comment in case you forget.

89
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,600
This is when successfully logged in on the dashboard panel,

90
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:29,400
we can go to the website here, we click the

91
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:39,500
website button to start then we click create website.

92
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:58,600
Now, we're going to use Default mode.

93
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:05,600
enter your domain email and PHP version that

94
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:12,206
we will use

95
00:14:12,206 --> 00:14:21,600
Select owner, choose Admin, domain, then email your email address and the PHP version we will use.

96
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:28,800
There is also optional feature like SSL

97
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:39,727
and DKIM for email security.

98
00:14:41,576 --> 00:14:48,500
Here is the interface. Fill up this form

99
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:53,000
from select package, select on owner, domain name, email

100
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:02,837
and what PHP version will we use then tick DKIM support and SSL

101
00:15:02,837 --> 00:15:07,287
Then click Create Website

102
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:29,900
Now after successfully creating an account

103
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:36,400
for website, then next we will

104
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,600
install WordPress on the that account

105
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,600
that we created earlier using the installer application,

106
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:53,044
so the application installer already include WordPress and LSCache.

107
00:15:57,925 --> 00:16:13,262
We are going to install WordPress with the addition of the LSCache feature in php 8

108
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:25,368
Now we fill in the blog, blog title, login user and the login password

109
00:16:25,368 --> 00:16:30,365
what is the email for this.

110
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:35,600
Leave it blank for path

111
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,200
if we have our special folder can fill in the name of the

112
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,100
folder, if we use default, it's better

113
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,800
to just leave it blank.

114
00:16:50,007 --> 00:16:59,500
Now, this is how it looks, click install now, if you are sure of the

115
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:05,400
settings that we have entered. 

116
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,900
If it successful we can access it with the domain name slash

117
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:15,396
wp-login.php

118
00:17:16,516 --> 00:17:23,100
Now, these are the steps for enabling

119
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:31,000
LetsEncrypt SSL on our Cyberpanel.

120
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,200
First, we need to make sure that the DNS is properly configured

121
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:43,400
using the DNS checker feature.

122
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:51,900
Check it using dnschecker.org

123
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:59,800
After that, just login to our Cyberpanel dashboard.

124
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:11,700
On the left side of the panel, follow these (flow) buttons

125
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:18,700
click menu SSL > manage SSL  > and then select the website that

126
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:29,148
we want to attach SSL on it and then click the Issus SSL.

127
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:50,800
Ah, this is tips & trick for LSCache plugin settings.

128
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:58,540
LSCache itself is automatically installed when we success install Wordpress.

129
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,300
So we can customize the settings.

130
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,100
First, we go to the LSCache setting.

131
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:21,500
If we want advanced or special settings,

132
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:33,100
we can set http2 to on then

133
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:39,600
we can delete the query string then remove wordpress emoji.

134
00:19:47,593 --> 00:19:48,351
etc

135
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:14,600
We can restore the old Wordpress from another host too

136
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:24,000
but this is not for beginner

137
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:35,500
because you must understand about SFTP,

138
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:41,200
compressing and extracting Wordpress directory to

139
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,900
the new one.

140
00:20:42,343 --> 00:21:02,404
So there are several plans to move the new WordPress.

141
00:21:02,404 --> 00:21:06,100
First of all we have to backup

142
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:15,400
using the tools feature.

143
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:22,300
After the backup process have been successful, then the backup file needs to be 

144
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:28,000
uploaded to a new one using an SFTP server or

145
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,600
another thing like rsync.

146
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:44,000
In the new server, we need to restore but we need to change PHP 8 settings on the

147
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,100
manage PHP > Basic > 

148
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,900
select the version 8.0 > 

149
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:57,800
then increase the post_max_size

150
00:21:58,871 --> 00:22:06,471
Because the compressed wordpress will be more than 10 MB.

151
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,900
After that it should be successfully restored.

152
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:27,000
Now in this cyberpanel feature there is also a benchmark.

153
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,100
So what we are trying to test is 10,000 clients/second

154
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:41,900
on the homepage and the average time is

155
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:55,000
100 milliseconds so we can successfully test 20,000 clients per second

156
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:09,000
for the first 10 seconds.

157
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,292
This results look like this.

158
00:23:21,977 --> 00:23:34,577
Now the second we try to test a total of 10000 clients on the post page

159
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:54,038
We try to run the test for 20 seconds and the success rate is 100%.

160
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:07,100
so at least we get 10000 hits per

161
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:14,200
second on our WordPress and use

162
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:23,800
the Ocean digital panel vps server at a price of 5 dollars per month

163
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:38,800
that is enough. So actually using Ubuntu for treatment

164
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:47,500
5 dollars the price is on digitalocean and the test results are

165
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:57,100
good (test 1 and test 2). You can try this.

166
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:16,400
Ok. that is all from me.

167
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,100
Thank you very much. You can contact me by

168
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:28,200
email: kontak@darian.my.id or instagram

169
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,000
@darian.my.id

170
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:41,010
Good bye. Thankyou.
