1
00:00:07,034 --> 00:00:13,263
Hello. In this session, we would like to introduce the opensource contributhon

2
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:18,714
as a way to increase new participants or contributors to open source in Korea.

3
00:00:18,714 --> 00:00:23,619
There are 3 presenters including myself for this presentation.

4
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:26,146
First, let me introduce myself.

5
00:00:26,146 --> 00:00:31,168
My name is Bok-mi Han, who works for an organization called the National IT Industry Promotion Agency of Korea

6
00:00:31,168 --> 00:00:36,820
 and is the leader of the open source promotion team. Nice to see you.

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:43,631
In this session, I would like to introduce the background of the promotion of the Opensource Contributhon and the current status of its activities.

8
00:00:43,631 --> 00:00:54,002
The second presenter is Youngbin Han, who is the representative of the Ubuntu Korean Community, and is participating in UbuCon Asia 2021 preparations.

9
00:00:54,002 --> 00:01:02,268
He will share with you the experience of participating as a mentor for the Ubuntu Korean Translation team at the Opensource Contributhon last year.

10
00:01:02,268 --> 00:01:15,081
The third and final presenter is Joowon Jung, who is a computer science graduate. She is a member of the Ubuntu Korean community and active on the Ubuntu Korean translation team.

11
00:01:15,081 --> 00:01:22,813
She will share her experience as a mentee for the Ubuntu Korean Translation team at the Opensource Contributhon last year.

12
00:01:25,982 --> 00:01:30,505
First, let me introduce about the Opensource Contributhon.

13
00:01:32,771 --> 00:01:37,836
The word "Contributhon" may sound unfamiliar.

14
00:01:37,836 --> 00:01:42,500
"Contributhon", which is the compound word of Contribution and Marathon,

15
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,667
is the program where  a mentor, who is a senior developer, and a number of mentees form a team

16
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:56,454
and the mentee can directly experience the opensource culture by contributing in a variety of ways. 

17
00:01:56,454 --> 00:02:07,900
During the Contributhon process, 1~3 mentors and 15 mentees perform the mission together for 6 weeks.

18
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:15,200
Contributhon activities were offline before COVID-19, but now are mainly online meetings.

19
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,022
I has been found that having at least the first one or two times to network with each other between teammates through offline meetings

20
00:02:21,022 --> 00:02:27,327
rather than online meetings is very important.

21
00:02:28,641 --> 00:02:31,853
I will explain the Contributhon operating process.

22
00:02:31,853 --> 00:02:34,674
To explain the ,

23
00:02:34,674 --> 00:02:40,000
at first, select the projects and mentors, and then recruit mentees, 

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,918
and the next 6 weeks the team work on, finally hold the awards ceremony.

25
00:02:44,918 --> 00:02:47,418
Let me explain in a little more detail.

26
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:55,333
First, We call for OSS projects and mentors then select among them for Contributhon.

27
00:02:55,333 --> 00:03:00,705
Any opensource project can apply for participation.

28
00:03:00,705 --> 00:03:06,584
Opensource experts select 25 projects to participate in through screening.

29
00:03:06,584 --> 00:03:15,175
Second, We call for mentees who will participate for selected OSS projects then select among them.

30
00:03:16,676 --> 00:03:26,486
This year, about 370 mentees were selected, and the competition was very high.

31
00:03:26,486 --> 00:03:34,644
Third, mentors and mentees form the teams and start 6 weeks of activities with the kick-off ceremony.

32
00:03:34,644 --> 00:03:41,314
Through 6 weeks of mentoring, mentees learn to contribute and grow together.

33
00:03:41,314 --> 00:03:46,484
Fourth, at the end, each team share the 6-week activities,

34
00:03:46,484 --> 00:03:53,086
and all mentors evaluate together to select and announce the best team. 

35
00:03:53,086 --> 00:04:02,089
These programs have been promoted by Ministry of Science and ICT and National IT Industry Promotion Agency in Korea since 2016.

36
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:10,282
Next, I'll tell you about the purpose of the Opensource Contributhon.

37
00:04:10,282 --> 00:04:18,341
Contributhon values “how” rather than “what” and “process” rather than “product”. 

38
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:28,300
It is the natural spirit of open source, and mentors mentor how to contribute these natural things. 

39
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,400
In particular,

40
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,200
they engage in various contribution activities such as

41
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:39,300
code review, bug reporting, questions, issues, comments, suggestions, and documentation. 

42
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:46,500
A lot of developer or student in Korea are developing using opensource.

43
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:53,880
However, there are still very few people who contribute beyond just using opensource. 

44
00:04:53,880 --> 00:05:03,900
Contributon wants to share and spread the open source development culture and value of contribution

45
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,300
to participants who have not yet contributed. 

46
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:14,092
Contributhon consists of the mentors, the mentees, and the projects.

47
00:05:14,092 --> 00:05:18,591
Of course, we can’t forget the Contributhon Secretariat, 

48
00:05:18,591 --> 00:05:22,085
which helps the Contributhon run well in an invisible place .

49
00:05:22,085 --> 00:05:29,541
Mentors are the opensource experts,

50
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:33,546
who plays the role of  project contributor, committer, maintainer, or owner at the opensource projects, and are the teachers of the mentees.

51
00:05:33,546 --> 00:05:38,480
About one to three mentors are on  a team,

52
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:46,700
and most of them are employees belonging to companies and are very busy with their work. 

53
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,639
However, they participated with a passion for opensource.

54
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,500
Most mentees are junior developers or students

55
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,060
who are interested in opensource but have never participated.

56
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:05,954
Through this opportunity, they get to know new people and learn new things very seriously. 

57
00:06:05,954 --> 00:06:12,954
About 10 to 15 mentees participate in a team, and most try to complete,

58
00:06:12,954 --> 00:06:17,600
but some fail to complete, so the completion rate is about 80%. 

59
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:25,318
There are cases in which the mentee grows and participates as a mentor in the next year.

60
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:29,354
Each project is a project in which mentors are active,

61
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:34,051
including development projects or translation projects.

62
00:06:34,051 --> 00:06:40,226
Any OSS project that wants to increase its contributors can be said to be a target.

63
00:06:43,951 --> 00:06:51,240
The screen you see now shows the projects and companies in which the mentors who have participated so far have been active. 

64
00:06:51,240 --> 00:07:02,297
They are participating in Contributhon in various projects such as

65
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:06,738
the well-known OpenStack, Keras, Linux Kernel, RosettaStone, Apache Zeppelin, Armeria, Tizen, and Ethereum Foundation projects.

66
00:07:06,738 --> 00:07:17,313
As is the global trend, AI-related projects are also popular in Korea recently.

67
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:24,939
In addition, not only development projects, but also projects for Korean translation are involved. 

68
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:31,817
In Korea, Korean translation is also very important to increase opensource participation.

69
00:07:31,817 --> 00:07:39,591
There are some cases that each OSS project operate its own contributhon now.

70
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:49,100
It is a very desirable phenomenon for a civilian project to take care of what the government started and do it on their own.

71
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:57,193
Like this, developers and companies in Korea are making great efforts to increase the number of open source participants. 

72
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:07,250
This slide shows the history of Contributhon,

73
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:14,673
which has been promoted annually for 6 years from 2016 to present 2021.

74
00:08:14,673 --> 00:08:23,330
As you can see on the previous page, about 85 projects were involved,

75
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:29,248
131 mentors and 1169 mentees participated.

76
00:08:29,248 --> 00:08:31,511
As you can see from the graph on the right,

77
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,562
the number of participants is increasing every year.

78
00:08:34,562 --> 00:08:40,175
As such, it is being promoted with the interest of many people.

79
00:08:40,175 --> 00:08:51,204
This year, 25 projects, 50 mentors, and 373 mentees participate, making it the largest ever.

80
00:08:53,545 --> 00:08:56,886
This is the history of Contributhon's activities.

81
00:08:56,886 --> 00:09:05,915
Before COVID-19, we gathered and held kickoffs, contribution activity meetings, awards ceremony, etc. offline.

82
00:09:05,915 --> 00:09:10,487
But since COVID-19, we are doing it online.

83
00:09:10,487 --> 00:09:16,629
This year, the kick-off was held on the metaverse platform, GatherTown.

84
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:21,700
It was fun and a new experience for me

85
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,327
to see about 400 people gather in Gather Town and move around.

86
00:09:25,327 --> 00:09:30,976
However, I miss having everyone gather together and start offline as before.

87
00:09:30,976 --> 00:09:37,343
Contribution activities are conducted by teams and led by mentors. 

88
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:42,989
They meet online or offline about once a week and work together.

89
00:09:42,989 --> 00:09:48,787
At the awards ceremony, each team's contribution activities are announced,

90
00:09:48,787 --> 00:09:52,498
and excellent teams are selected based on the evaluation of mentors.

91
00:09:52,498 --> 00:09:56,433
Excellent teams are awarded the Minister's Award from Ministry of Science and ICT,

92
00:09:56,433 --> 00:09:59,553
which establishes and promotes open source policies,

93
00:09:59,553 --> 00:10:03,918
and the Director's Award from National IT Industry Promotion Agency.

94
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,467
This year is 6 years since Contributon started, and this year there is a new change. 

95
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:18,751
It has been expanded to the contribution academy.

96
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:23,477
The short period of 6 weeks became a lot of pressure for the mentors,

97
00:10:23,477 --> 00:10:27,130
so we increased it to 4 months and lowered the burden on the mentors.

98
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:31,538
We also strengthened the basics as an academy. 

99
00:10:31,538 --> 00:10:37,142
Basic education such as Github usage education for junior developers has been added, 

100
00:10:37,142 --> 00:10:44,758
Mentors for each team can focus on mentoring opensource projects.

101
00:10:44,758 --> 00:10:52,189
Mentees were able to directly participate in team activities through basic training.

102
00:10:52,189 --> 00:10:57,506
 And by dividing Challenges program and Masters program,

103
00:10:57,506 --> 00:11:00,591
the opportunities for mentees to participate were diversified.

104
00:11:00,591 --> 00:11:08,470
In the Challenges program, mentees learn basic courses such as Github

105
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:13,761
and perform basic missions for each project, such as build and environment setting for about a month.

106
00:11:13,761 --> 00:11:18,276
In the Masters program, after completing the challenge program,

107
00:11:18,276 --> 00:11:22,280
team collaboration development activities are carried out

108
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,481
through regular mentoring of mentors for about 3 months.

109
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:31,733
This year, we are having fun with this new Contributhon.

110
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:45,279
In this page, I will introduce the open source promotion activities of the National IT Industry Promotion Agency, NIPA, which is promoting Contributhon. 

111
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:53,987
NIPA is Korea's IT and software development promotion agency along with the Ministry of Science and ICT. 

112
00:11:53,987 --> 00:12:03,863
In particular, NIPA's opensource promotion team supports various activities for Korean opensource developers, communities, and companies. 

113
00:12:03,863 --> 00:12:11,088
First, we are doing an Open Frontier or Contributhon business for open source developers.

114
00:12:11,088 --> 00:12:17,124
To support community activities, we support holding seminars and meetings,

115
00:12:17,124 --> 00:12:22,309
Due to COVID-19, we are currently supporting mainly online events.

116
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:26,510
In addition, we support opensource governance consulting for companies

117
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:30,320
such as opensource compliance and license,

118
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,785
and help companies establish opensource strategies.

119
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,774
We hold open source conferences every year

120
00:12:38,774 --> 00:12:44,357
to share information or create a forum for developers, communities, and companies to communicate. 

121
00:12:44,357 --> 00:12:52,824
This year, it will be held online at the end of November, and about 30 sessions are being prepared.

122
00:12:52,824 --> 00:13:02,636
In addition, we are operating the OpenUp Center as a space where open source developers and communities can come and work at any time.

123
00:13:02,636 --> 00:13:06,853
Lastly, we have developed a Linux-based open OS for desktop

124
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:11,185
and are distributing it for use by the government and the private sector.

125
00:13:11,185 --> 00:13:17,063
In this way, NIPA is providing various support for the opensource ecosystem.

126
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:19,063
So I hope for a lot of interest.

127
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:27,448
This figures are OpenUp center established to support open source integration.

128
00:13:27,448 --> 00:13:33,065
There is a development space, meeting space, seminar or education, and relaxation space,

129
00:13:33,065 --> 00:13:40,608
Opensource developers, communities, contributors, etc. can conveniently visit and use it at any time.

130
00:13:40,608 --> 00:13:45,960
So far, I have given you a general description of Contributhon,

131
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,000
so please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have

132
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,300
In the next part, Youngbin Han, who actually participated as a mentor at Contributhon,

133
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,321
will share her participation experience. 

134
00:14:01,668 --> 00:14:07,087
Hello, from now on, I would like to talk about my experience participating as a mentor

135
00:14:07,087 --> 00:14:12,178
for the Ubuntu Korean Translation Team at the Opensource Contributhon last year. 

136
00:14:15,561 --> 00:14:20,860
The Ubuntu Korean Community has been running a translation team

137
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,472
to translate packages included in Ubuntu for a long time.

138
00:14:24,472 --> 00:14:28,014
As those of you who have participated in Ubuntu translation are well aware,

139
00:14:28,014 --> 00:14:31,525
we have been contributing to Ubuntu translation through Launchpad.

140
00:14:33,003 --> 00:14:39,177
As with other opensources, there are always new contributors,

141
00:14:39,177 --> 00:14:43,213
and there are many who stop contributing in the middle.

142
00:14:44,494 --> 00:14:49,689
There are many people who are new to contributing voluntarily,

143
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:53,003
but there are many who do not know,

144
00:14:53,003 --> 00:14:56,100
and many who do not know how to start.

145
00:14:57,742 --> 00:15:04,071
So, in order to help those who are new to Ubuntu translation get a good start,

146
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:10,000
we regularly do documentation and hold workshop events for them.

147
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:19,627
In the past, before the spread of COVID-19, workshop events were often held like this photo.

148
00:15:20,906 --> 00:15:25,858
In addition to Ubuntu translation, we often held workshops on various topics

149
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:30,000
such as Debian packaging and the Internet of Things.

150
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:33,832
Through various workshop events,

151
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:40,000
we used to help people who want to contribute to Ubuntu for the first time to get started easily.

152
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:50,912
Usually, these workshop events were planned and held in the form of holding a one-day schedule,

153
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:57,116
which is similar to the workshop sessions at large conference events.

154
00:15:58,828 --> 00:16:05,400
In offline workshop events, participants usually take their time to participate,

155
00:16:06,385 --> 00:16:10,463
they have the advantage of being able to learn well by focusing more on the practice

156
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:16,243
and they can get help right away for parts they don't know or find difficult. 

157
00:16:20,676 --> 00:16:25,827
However, this one-day workshop event has some limitations.

158
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:30,294
Contributors can start contributing more easily

159
00:16:30,294 --> 00:16:33,710
compared to when they started contributing alone,

160
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:40,904
but usually they only contribute for a short period of time, such as a few days or months, after participating in the event,

161
00:16:40,904 --> 00:16:43,761
and then stop contributing. 

162
00:16:45,896 --> 00:16:50,850
For this reason, it is rare for those who started contributing through workshop participation

163
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:55,862
to become long-term contributors by continuing to contribute.

164
00:16:57,832 --> 00:17:03,053
And since last year, it is difficult to hold offline events due to the spread of COVID-19. 

165
00:17:05,254 --> 00:17:08,108
Due to social distancing,

166
00:17:09,852 --> 00:17:13,529
it was impossible to hold an offline event with a large number of people,

167
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:18,069
so it was necessary to move offline activities online. 

168
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,041
Meanwhile, last year, I joined the Opensource Contributhon as a mentor for the first time.

169
00:17:28,453 --> 00:17:33,855
I had heard of this event before participating in the Opensource Contributhon,

170
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:37,826
so I knew about it and was interested.

171
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:42,387
However, it was difficult for me to participate because I was serving in the military. 

172
00:17:43,471 --> 00:17:45,766
After completing my military service last year,

173
00:17:45,766 --> 00:17:48,423
I joined it at the request of other organizers.

174
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:56,507
So, for a longer period of six weeks, we were able to be with these who first to participate in the Ubuntu translation.

175
00:17:58,313 --> 00:18:03,842
Since the opensource contributhon I participated in last year was the activity after the spread of COVID-19,

176
00:18:04,663 --> 00:18:09,341
I also had the opportunity to think about

177
00:18:09,341 --> 00:18:11,943
how to continue offline activities online after the spread of COVID-19. 

178
00:18:15,568 --> 00:18:20,790
Fortunately, last summer, there was a time when offline meetings were possible for a short time,

179
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:27,170
so the 6-week Contributhon activities started with the offline initiation ceremony. 

180
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:32,617
After the kick-off ceremony, training was conducted for mentees,

181
00:18:32,617 --> 00:18:35,142
which is similar to the translation workshop we've done before.

182
00:18:36,461 --> 00:18:40,716
The picture you see now is a picture I took while training for the mentees.

183
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:47,416
We've provided training and hands-on training from how to sign up for Launchpad, to sign up for Ubuntu's Code of Conduct with your GPG key,

184
00:18:48,138 --> 00:18:52,450
and to submit translation suggestions.

185
00:18:56,228 --> 00:18:59,527
Contributing as a translation, if you speak English well,

186
00:18:59,527 --> 00:19:04,724
is relatively easy to get started with, compared to contributing by writing code.

187
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:10,142
Becuase all you have to do is sign up for the launchpad, choose the packages you want to translate,

188
00:19:11,292 --> 00:19:14,323
and fill out and submit a translation proposal.

189
00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:21,122
There is no program to install, and you can start right from the web.

190
00:19:22,088 --> 00:19:26,032
There is no need to study a new programming language or technology in particular,

191
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,295
or to analyze existing source code.

192
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:34,828
But as easy as it is to start, it can quickly become boring and tiring. 

193
00:19:39,032 --> 00:19:46,328
Because if you contribute to opensource through development, you can contribute by checking if there is any problem with your work, 

194
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:53,103
but most of the UI translation is a repetitive task of translating short or long English strings. 

195
00:19:55,402 --> 00:20:00,586
Since Ubuntu translation from the launchpad usually submited directly from the web,

196
00:20:00,586 --> 00:20:05,700
it is difficult to check whether the translation is natural in the actual program.

197
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:11,661
There are many cases where it is not possible to fully translate a single package.

198
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:16,220
Sometimes it's because there are too many strings included in the package,

199
00:20:17,534 --> 00:20:20,000
sometimes the included strings are constantly changing,

200
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:27,900
or the package no longer needs to be translated, because it was deprecated.

201
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,624
Those who start contributing translations for the first time do not take this into account

202
00:20:36,084 --> 00:20:41,303
and many of them focus only on translating a large amount of strings in a short time,

203
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:44,250
and then give up after getting tired of it. 

204
00:20:47,928 --> 00:20:52,311
In Contributhon, it is not important to achieve results in a short period of time,

205
00:20:52,311 --> 00:20:57,957
but to help mentees finish without getting tired for a long period of time.

206
00:20:59,307 --> 00:21:02,900
There are a few things we've introduced to help them get to the finish line.

207
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:07,400
First, we had them set individual weekly translation goals. 

208
00:21:09,338 --> 00:21:15,080
Mentors and mentees often each have their own work, such as study or company work,

209
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:20,000
and each has a different amount of time to invest in opensource contributions. 

210
00:21:22,054 --> 00:21:24,951
It is not important to do a lot of translation,

211
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:28,410
but it is more important to accurately translate even a small amount of translation,

212
00:21:29,428 --> 00:21:33,574
and to continuously translate and manage changed strings.

213
00:21:34,968 --> 00:21:38,711
By setting a goal for the number of strings that can be translated per week,

214
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:42,546
and allowing each mentee to translate as much as their goal,

215
00:21:42,981 --> 00:21:45,011
the burden of contributing to translation was reduced,

216
00:21:45,569 --> 00:21:48,317
and mentees did not get tired quickly.

217
00:21:52,302 --> 00:21:54,708
As with other Linux distributions,

218
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:58,175
Ubuntu has an innumerable variety of packages,

219
00:21:58,175 --> 00:22:00,580
and all of them are subject to translation.

220
00:22:01,277 --> 00:22:05,725
However, of course, not all packages can be translated,

221
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:09,860
so we divided the participating mentees into small teams

222
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:15,699
so that each team can choose one to four packages and focus on translating them.

223
00:22:17,522 --> 00:22:25,097
By setting up a mentor for each team and providing translation feedback for each team,

224
00:22:25,614 --> 00:22:30,000
the mentee's burden on translation proposals and the mentee's translation review burden were reduced,

225
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:32,631
helping to make better translations.

226
00:22:37,676 --> 00:22:41,173
In order for the mentees to do well until the end,

227
00:22:41,173 --> 00:22:46,209
it would be very helpful to provide feedback and let them know if they are doing well.

228
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:50,612
As mentioned earlier,

229
00:22:50,612 --> 00:22:54,057
due to the nature of Ubuntu translation,

230
00:22:54,057 --> 00:22:56,818
which usually submits translations directly through the launchpad on the web,

231
00:22:56,818 --> 00:23:00,302
it is not easy to check whether the translation is natural in the actual program

232
00:23:00,302 --> 00:23:02,860
before submitting the translation.

233
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,863
That's why it's important to provide frequent feedback.

234
00:23:09,696 --> 00:23:13,178
At Contributhon, we had to submit a midterm report,

235
00:23:13,178 --> 00:23:18,270
so there were times to check whether the mentees were doing well.

236
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,364
Usually, while reviewing translation proposals,

237
00:23:22,364 --> 00:23:26,630
we sometimes provide feedback on incorrect translations

238
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,445
or translations that can be improved.

239
00:23:31,939 --> 00:23:38,300
We helped them by asking questions even when they were not sure how to translate,

240
00:23:39,088 --> 00:23:42,739
and also shared about common translation mistakes, various translation conventions,

241
00:23:42,739 --> 00:23:47,708
the translation rules of the Ubuntu Korean Translation Team, and glossary.

242
00:23:53,281 --> 00:23:59,624
Opensource Contributhon is not only a mentoring program, but also a competition.

243
00:23:59,624 --> 00:24:07,634
So, at the end, the performance of each project was announced, evaluated, and awards were given. 

244
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,030
It felt a little new to me to evaluate and give awards in the mentoring program.

245
00:24:20,655 --> 00:24:27,330
When presenting and evaluating the performance, mentors for each project participated in the evaluation,

246
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,874
and I participated in the Ubuntu Korean Translation Team.

247
00:24:32,024 --> 00:24:37,959
All of the mentees for each project have very good presentations and the results were so good that

248
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:43,017
it was difficult to evaluate which project came out better. 

249
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:49,131
The performance presentation was a short time of 5 minutes for each team, 

250
00:24:49,131 --> 00:24:51,463
but since there are many teams presenting,

251
00:24:51,463 --> 00:24:56,868
it must have been very difficult to sit down for a long time and concentrate on the presentations of the mentees.

252
00:25:02,517 --> 00:25:10,311
Through Contributhon, I was able to meet new mentees who wanted to contribute to Ubuntu translation,

253
00:25:11,362 --> 00:25:17,040
and working with mentees for a long time, we were able to significantly improve the quality of Ubuntu translation.

254
00:25:18,801 --> 00:25:21,646
The result was remarkably good.

255
00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:27,325
First, some of the mentees were ranked among the top 20 contributors

256
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:29,325
to the launchpad translation.

257
00:25:31,171 --> 00:25:35,218
Translations contributed by mentees were reviewed by mentors,

258
00:25:35,218 --> 00:25:37,618
and were immediately reflected in Ubuntu 20.10,

259
00:25:37,618 --> 00:25:40,690
which was released after the period of activity.

260
00:25:42,037 --> 00:25:43,950
While participating in Contributhon,

261
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,461
I thought about what could be improved in the operation of the translation team.

262
00:25:49,107 --> 00:25:53,108
The Ubuntu Korean translation team document is well documented

263
00:25:53,108 --> 00:25:56,488
on the translation rules and translation methods,

264
00:25:57,082 --> 00:26:00,000
but there is a problem in a place that is not easy to find for those

265
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,624
who want to contribute to the translation for the first time. 

266
00:26:03,947 --> 00:26:07,327
I thought we should improve the documentation to make it easier to find. 

267
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:13,487
We also thought of improving the documentation on

268
00:26:13,487 --> 00:26:19,362
how to actually test what a translation will look like before submitting a translation suggestion

269
00:26:19,362 --> 00:26:23,625
so we can get a better translation. 

270
00:26:26,256 --> 00:26:30,912
So far, I've talked about my experience as a mentor

271
00:26:30,912 --> 00:26:34,653
to Opensource Contributhon last year.

272
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:45,000
Next, Joowon Jung will tell you about her experience as a mentee for the Ubuntu Korean Translation project. 

273
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:54,386
Hello, I would like to present my experience as a mentee

274
00:26:54,386 --> 00:27:00,418
for the 2020 Opensource Contributhon Ubuntu Korean Translation Project. 

275
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:07,640
I heard the word opensource a lot when I was in college,

276
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,658
but I didn't know exactly what it was. 

277
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:15,200
Distributed free of charge, and anyone can modify it and redistribute it.

278
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,100
I just understood it that way.

279
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,216
In the meantime, through a class called Introduction To Opeonsource Software,

280
00:27:23,216 --> 00:27:27,417
I became interested in open source software.

281
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:30,771
Through the research assignment on opensource trends,

282
00:27:30,771 --> 00:27:34,446
 I learned that opensource software also has licenses

283
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:40,289
and that open source software mainly grows with the community,

284
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:44,818
and my interest in opensource software grew.

285
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:50,858
Of course, I was just interested in it rather than making any contribution.

286
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:56,433
While looking for various information about open source software,

287
00:27:56,433 --> 00:28:00,000
I came across various developer communities,

288
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,681
and in the meantime I came across an activity called Opensource Contributhon. 

289
00:28:05,681 --> 00:28:09,367
I was interested in hearing that it was an activity where I could contribute to an opensource project

290
00:28:09,367 --> 00:28:15,541
with the help of senior developers who participated as mentors.

291
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:20,295
Getting information about various opensource software,

292
00:28:20,295 --> 00:28:24,663
I thought that I would like to contribute to an opensource project someday,

293
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:29,095
but I was hesitant about how to contribute to which project

294
00:28:29,095 --> 00:28:35,135
and where and how to start and was unable to start anything.

295
00:28:35,135 --> 00:28:39,444
So this activity came as a great opportunity for me.

296
00:28:39,444 --> 00:28:43,379
Even though I am interested in any open source project,

297
00:28:43,379 --> 00:28:49,156
I have no idea how to start even after reading the guide page for new contributors,

298
00:28:49,156 --> 00:28:55,577
and even the Best First Issue, which is left as an issue that beginners can contribute, feels difficult.

299
00:28:55,577 --> 00:29:01,551
However, by participating in the Opensource Contributhon,

300
00:29:01,551 --> 00:29:05,259
it seemed that it would be easier to contribute with the help of senior developers. 

301
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:11,735
Looking around the various opensource projects participating in the Opensource Contributhon,

302
00:29:11,735 --> 00:29:15,499
I thought about which project it would be better to participate in,

303
00:29:15,499 --> 00:29:19,830
but I chose the Ubuntu Korean Translation project and applied for it.

304
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,935
I felt that my development ability was still insufficient

305
00:29:23,935 --> 00:29:27,099
to contribute to an opensource project through coding,

306
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:32,388
so I thought it would be good to start contributing as a translation project.

307
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,068
And as a Ubuntu user,

308
00:29:36,068 --> 00:29:41,563
I wanted to participate in an opensource project for the operating system I use on a daily basis.

309
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:47,475
I applied for the Ubuntu Korean translation project and was selected as a mentee,

310
00:29:47,475 --> 00:29:51,062
and I started Contributhon activities for 6 weeks.

311
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,473
Contributhon activities started with hearing about the Ubuntu Korean translation project

312
00:29:59,473 --> 00:30:03,954
and joining the Ubuntu Korean Translation team.

313
00:30:03,954 --> 00:30:12,025
Since the Ubuntu Korean Translation project is being conducted on a platform called Launchpad, we joined Launchpad.

314
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:19,488
In the process, we generated a GPG key and signed the Code of Conduct, etc.

315
00:30:19,488 --> 00:30:25,714
It is the first time to generate a GPG key and to do an electronic signature through it.

316
00:30:25,714 --> 00:30:27,917
Even this is unfamiliar,

317
00:30:27,917 --> 00:30:31,211
so if I had started it by myself rather than participating Contributhon,

318
00:30:31,211 --> 00:30:34,048
 I think I would have lost my way here.

319
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,635
Still, the mentors explained to us step by step and guided us

320
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:41,293
so that we would not give up while wandering in unfamiliar tasks, 

321
00:30:41,293 --> 00:30:44,482
so we were able to do it without difficulty. 

322
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,632
To join the Ubuntu Korean translation team,

323
00:30:48,632 --> 00:30:53,000
you need to sign up for the launchpad, subscribe to the Ubuntu Korean translation team mailing,

324
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,100
and accumulate at least 50 karma.

325
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,914
Karma can be seen as an activity score on the Launchpad,

326
00:31:00,914 --> 00:31:05,541
which can be accumulated through contribution activities on the Launchpad,

327
00:31:05,541 --> 00:31:08,582
and disappears after a long period of time,

328
00:31:08,582 --> 00:31:11,233
so it indicate the amount of activity of the contributor.

329
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,448
Even if not joined the Ubuntu Korean translation team,

330
00:31:15,448 --> 00:31:18,827
you can build karma through translation suggestions,

331
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,370
so we took the time to make a translation suggestion

332
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:27,618
to get karma for joining the Ubuntu Korean Translation team.

333
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,022
In a situation where we cannot meet often due to COVID-19,

334
00:31:32,022 --> 00:31:35,993
time to apply for a member of the Ubuntu Korean Translation Team

335
00:31:35,993 --> 00:31:39,308
and practice translation proposals by meeting offline

336
00:31:39,308 --> 00:31:45,715
was an important first step in translation activities during the 6-week Contributhon period.

337
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:51,230
During that time by asking questions to the mentors,

338
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:54,653
we got used to the unfamiliar platform called Launchpad

339
00:31:54,653 --> 00:31:58,139
and learned how to translate activities there.

340
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:03,206
At first, there were a lot of trivial questions like

341
00:32:03,206 --> 00:32:06,247
"Is this right?", "Is it correct to press this button?",

342
00:32:06,247 --> 00:32:10,138
gradually we got used to it and were able to do it on our own.

343
00:32:13,715 --> 00:32:20,425
After applying to join the Ubuntu Korean translation team and practicing translation proposals in offline training,

344
00:32:20,425 --> 00:32:27,688
we have been translating online in the time we can contribute in our daily lives.

345
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,941
Translation work was performed on various packages

346
00:32:31,941 --> 00:32:34,684
Depending on the package, for some packages,

347
00:32:34,684 --> 00:32:41,150
it is easier to understand the context by

348
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:45,954
specifying where the text exists in which file in the package's git repository.

349
00:32:45,954 --> 00:32:51,301
However, in other packages, it was difficult to translate

350
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:55,000
because it was impossible to know in what context the text was used.

351
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,791
At times, I was not sure whether this expression was interpreted in this way in this context.

352
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:08,427
When I asked a question through the Contributhon channel of Ubuntu Korean Community Slack,

353
00:33:08,427 --> 00:33:14,128
the mentors thought about it together and suggested an appropriate translation,

354
00:33:14,128 --> 00:33:17,364
so it went smoothly to do translation work.

355
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:23,346
Even if not a question, there were cases when the translated sentences were not smooth,

356
00:33:23,346 --> 00:33:27,284
receiving feedback from mentors to refine the expression. 

357
00:33:28,171 --> 00:33:34,210
In addition, in selecting which package to translate among numerous packages,

358
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:38,581
as a reference when selecting a package to translate,

359
00:33:38,676 --> 00:33:46,188
the mentors recommended packages with a low translation rate even though they were major packages.

360
00:33:46,188 --> 00:33:51,924
So we were able to do many translations focusing on packages that users need more.

361
00:33:55,225 --> 00:33:58,553
The biggest stumbling block I felt while activities was that

362
00:33:58,553 --> 00:34:02,693
I couldn't see any noticeable results.

363
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:10,400
Unlike adding functions or fixing bugs in software, the results of the activities are not immediately visible.

364
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,219
Rather, the translation rate is only increasing little by little,

365
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:18,932
but that small increase was difficult to act as a meaningful motivator.

366
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,892
Afterwards, when the translated content was reflected in the Ubuntu distribution,

367
00:34:23,892 --> 00:34:28,949
I felt glad when I encountered  the packages I translated,

368
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:34,177
but during the Contributethon, the visibility of the activity was greatly reduced

369
00:34:34,177 --> 00:34:37,725
because it had not yet been reflected in the Ubuntu distribution.

370
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:45,700
And the difficult-to-translate texts we often encounter acted as another stumbling block.

371
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:49,000
If the git repository path is listed,

372
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,500
I first translated it by inferring the context,

373
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,708
and if it was not resolved,

374
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:58,883
I took the method of asking questions to the mentors.

375
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,200
Of course, there were cases where the text remained difficult to translate.

376
00:35:06,087 --> 00:35:12,157
In that case, it would be more beneficial to try to translate another text

377
00:35:12,157 --> 00:35:14,948
than to hold on to it, so I passed. 

378
00:35:15,966 --> 00:35:19,302
In the case of an unfamiliar package that I did not normally use,

379
00:35:19,302 --> 00:35:22,512
I was hesitant to translate it

380
00:35:22,512 --> 00:35:25,115
because I did not have prior knowledge about the package,

381
00:35:25,115 --> 00:35:30,234
but through a search, I was able to translate it better

382
00:35:30,234 --> 00:35:33,458
by figuring out the context of what the package does.

383
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:38,495
Certain proper nouns and verbs used within the package

384
00:35:38,495 --> 00:35:43,549
were judged to be transliterated as foreign words.

385
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,900
Sometimes the text to be translated contains an abbreviation

386
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:55,700
but it is difficult to know what the abbreviation is.

387
00:35:56,718 --> 00:36:00,594
Depending on the package, there are cases where it is written

388
00:36:00,594 --> 00:36:03,353
so that I can refer to what it stands for,

389
00:36:03,353 --> 00:36:05,600
but there are cases where it is not.

390
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,000
Abbreviations that can be inferred or appear immediately after searching

391
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,992
could be interpreted and translated as they are,

392
00:36:12,992 --> 00:36:15,698
but there were cases where it was the first abbreviation I had ever seen

393
00:36:15,698 --> 00:36:18,756
and I did not understand it even if I searched.

394
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,338
Sometimes I couldn't figure it out, so I passed it, 

395
00:36:22,338 --> 00:36:27,852
but the abbreviation found in another package showed what it means,

396
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:33,725
and I realized later that the one I had seen before seemed to have the same meaning.

397
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:43,000
After six weeks of Contributhon work, we looked back at our achievements.

398
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:48,153
On the day we met offline and joined the Ubuntu Korean translation team,

399
00:36:48,153 --> 00:36:51,700
we set a goal for each of our translation activities.

400
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:55,884
When we checked how much we had achieved compared to the goal,

401
00:36:55,884 --> 00:36:59,300
some mentees translated several times the target amount,

402
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,223
but some mentees did not reach the goal sufficiently.

403
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,126
During the contribution period,

404
00:37:07,126 --> 00:37:11,100
a total of 4,636 translation contributions were made by us,

405
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:17,870
and two of us including myself were ranked among the top 20

406
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:21,534
in the translation category of the TOP contributors ranking,

407
00:37:21,534 --> 00:37:24,553
which ranked the contributions of Ubuntu contributors worldwide.

408
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:30,389
Our translations were reflected in the Ubuntu 20.10 Groovy Gorilla version

409
00:37:30,389 --> 00:37:34,413
released after the Contributhon activity ended.

410
00:37:34,873 --> 00:37:41,174
It's meaningful to me as a Ubuntu user and as a contributor to the translation activity

411
00:37:41,174 --> 00:37:49,092
that many Ubuntu Korean users can use packages we translated. 

412
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:58,557
There were mentees who expressed their intention to continue to participate in the Ubuntu Korean Translation project even after the contributhon period was over.

413
00:37:58,557 --> 00:38:03,902
and some of them actually continued their translation activities even after the end of their official activities,

414
00:38:03,902 --> 00:38:09,154
resulting in continuous Ubuntu Korean Translation contributors.

415
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,460
Of course, there were a few things that were disappointing.

416
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,875
As it is a project in which each individual translates independently rather than collaborating with someone else,

417
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:28,095
there is an advantage in that each of them can work independently and voluntarily at a convenient time

418
00:38:28,095 --> 00:38:30,829
without difficulty in time coordination and communication.

419
00:38:30,829 --> 00:38:35,699
But There were aspects of it that were not very well motivating

420
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:40,000
because there is almost no communication between mentees and only repeating similar translation work alone.

421
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:47,495
I heard that some mentees, before the start of the contributhon activity, applied for this project in expect that

422
00:38:47,495 --> 00:38:51,006
the activity of translating the applications' man page

423
00:38:51,006 --> 00:38:55,516
rather than translating the text of the operating system utility

424
00:38:55,516 --> 00:38:59,027
due to lack of understanding of the Ubuntu Korean translation project.

425
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:04,583
This feeling of disparity between expectations and reality may served as one of the reasons

426
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:11,394
why some mentees did not fully reach their goals for translation activities.

427
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,241
I think about how it would have been if I had personally jumped into the path of a contributor

428
00:39:18,241 --> 00:39:21,000
to the Ubuntu Korean Translation project

429
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,228
by myself without participating in the opensource contributhon.

430
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,224
Even the process of signing up for Launchpad and joining the Ubuntu Korean Translation team must have gone through a lot.

431
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:34,716
Even after joining the Ubuntu Korean translation team,

432
00:39:34,716 --> 00:39:40,493
I pondered whether it was right to submit this like this, or whether it was appropriate to translate it like this in this situation,

433
00:39:40,493 --> 00:39:45,285
and I think that I may have given up after not long in the end.

434
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,148
Of course, in such a case, there is a community where I can leave a question,

435
00:39:50,148 --> 00:39:53,956
and I could have moved forward with the help of such a community,

436
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,866
but having someone you can ask a question comfortably

437
00:39:57,866 --> 00:40:01,869
is a big help when you apply for a bill in an unfamiliar field. 

438
00:40:04,073 --> 00:40:09,365
Participating in the Opensource Contributhon Ubuntu Korean Translation project last year,

439
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:14,247
I felt that my experience of contributing to the opensource project was very meaningful and rewarding.

440
00:40:14,247 --> 00:40:18,250
So this year, I am participating in Opensource Contribution Academy,

441
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:22,034
which was reorganized Opensource Contributhon.

442
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:30,100
This time, I applied to the RustPython project to challenge the contribution through coding.

443
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:36,375
These days, I have been busy with various things, so I haven't been active since last June,

444
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:42,400
but when I have time again, I will try to contribute to the Ubuntu Korean Translation project again in my spare time.

445
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,123
This concludes the presentation. Thank you.
