28
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:24,535
Oke, thank you Mr. Fadhil for the introduction

29
00:02:24,897 --> 00:02:27,902
today we have 2 main topics in this presentation

30
00:02:27,902 --> 00:02:30,879
the first is
[Topic 1 title]

31
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,438
that will be presented by me

32
00:02:33,438 --> 00:02:37,901
and the second is
[Topic 2 title]

33
00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:42,640
that will be presented by Mr. Fadhil

34
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:49,594
Oke, first, I'm going to talk about the history of Kelompok Linux Arek Suroboyo (KLAS)

35
00:02:49,594 --> 00:02:57,804
KLAS was actually founded in 1995 but it went vacuum and refounded again in 1998

36
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:04,640
by the first KLAS chairman, Muhammad Noor Al Azam in his house, Surabaya.

37
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:12,338
You can see the right picture
it was the oldest documented event of KLAS in 2003.

38
00:03:12,338 --> 00:03:17,258
it was talking about IT and copyright

39
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,239
at that time, the event is quite big tho because

40
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,760
it was attended by around 400 people

41
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,440
and we have quite big sponsor too at the event
so I can say that

42
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,920
it was a big event for us

43
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,239
Oke
this is the slides

44
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,280
it's talking about out first basecamp that collaborated with

45
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,697
Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS),
which is my alma mater in early 2000

46
00:03:56,785 --> 00:04:03,040
we collaborated with ITS because we have the same vision & mission to share knowledge and

47
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:09,200
do education about information technology (IT)
to Surabayans dan Indonesia.

48
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,599
honestly until today, we are still

49
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,880
having collab with ITS but in different circumstances

50
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,360
and our basecamp right now has already moved from ITS to

51
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,759
Intiland Tower 11th floor

52
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,000
Oke, this is one of our oldest events too. The event was

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,400
Software Freedom Day in Surabaya in 2005.

54
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,840
at that time, we were not just talking about

55
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:52,728
software, freedom, or open source,
we were also talking about Linux itself.

56
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,360
There is a funny story behind the CD (Compact Disc) where this CD is a key from

57
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,120
Chronicle that we were going to distribute

58
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,440
so the CD is being held by the customs, so we need to pay the tax

59
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,160
for the gift that has been sent by Chronicle, but...

60
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,759
you know?
we were actually not

61
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,720
"borrowing" a gift,
that was literally a "gift"

62
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:31,310
so we don't pay any money for that gift

63
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,400
so the tax would have been 0 because

64
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,560
it has no price on that gift but

65
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,759
at that time, we have quite

66
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:52,479
sort of money for paying the tax, 
so it was impossible for us to

67
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:58,880
pay the tax impossed to us, then we decided to give up and just ask the

68
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:06,068
officer to just return the gift to the sender which is Chronical.

69
00:06:06,609 --> 00:06:13,520
but lucky us, while dealing with the officer,
we got a call from Suara Surabaya,

70
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,800
which was one of the biggest radio media in Surabaya at the time

71
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,560
regarding about our plan about IT dialog Talkshow in the radio.

72
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,800
so at that time was KLAS and Suara Surabaya

73
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,360
talking about IT

74
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,080
we deliberately spoke out loud in front of the officer

75
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,240
and we were little worried

76
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,840
that the CD that came

77
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:52,236
the CD is already came but it was detained by the customs

78
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,680
we told them that, unfortunately

79
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,440
we were afraid that our event cannot be continued again because

80
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,639
our stuff is being held by the customs

81
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,440
we talk like that quite loudly so

82
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,240
the office could hear what we are talking about

83
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,360
and then after we finished meeting with the media

84
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:33,531
the officer asked us 
"is this later to be distributed to an event sir?"

85
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:46,251
and we said "yes of course! we are going to make IT Talkshow event and we are going to distribute the CD, not to sell it!"

86
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:58,838
then the officer said
"oh ok if that so, you can take the CD, no need to pay the tax!"

87
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,440
"you just need to pay the repacking fee"

88
00:08:05,182 --> 00:08:10,000
Finally, we were able to distribute a lot of CDs

89
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,639
the gift from Chronical. 
so what's the point?

90
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,080
the point is the power of media,
we should not

91
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,280
underestimate the power of media, you know ehe...

92
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,400
OK
it was quite funny for us tho :)

93
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,440
here is another one of our oldest event

94
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,159
in Kelompok Linux Arek Suroboyo

95
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,880
which is one of the oldest "cangkrukan" that we're going to talk about it later.

96
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,839
it was talking about the introduction and installation of OpenSUSE LINUX 10

97
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,600
it was held on

98
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,800
Saturday, 15 October 2005
at workshop room Hi Tech Mall Surabaya

99
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,440
so it was talking about linux installation and the use of

100
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,600
multimedia and office application so
yes

101
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:18,264
the price was 50.000 rupiah

102
00:09:18,264 --> 00:09:22,720
if we convert it to USD, it was 

103
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,399
around 5 bucks,
but for today

104
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,640
because of the inflation, the price would have been

105
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:40,669
150.000 rupiah which is quite 15 dollar

106
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:48,214
it was quite expensive for some of us in Surabaya at that time,

107
00:09:48,214 --> 00:09:51,440
maybe for you, 10 bucks can be used to buy a

108
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,440
burger to eat or something

109
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,800
uh
that's kinda cheap you know...

110
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,399
but for us, it was expensive
so that's why the absorb of technology

111
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:09,234
at that time was quite slow in Surabaya
because the expensiveness of knowledge

112
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:15,200
next I'm going to introduce you our head of community of 

113
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,200
Kelompok Linux Arek Suroboyo

114
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,120
from our founder until me, who is on duty right now, we have been serving for

115
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:31,341
more than 20 years but yeah.. only 4 of us who ever lead from the founder to me

116
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,040
the founder was Mr. Muammar Al Azam
dan the second head was

117
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:43,777
Darian Rizaluddin and the third was Joko Susilo and the fourth is me right now

118
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,240
OK, next is I'm going to talk about what we are going to do today

119
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:58,839
and what we've been done in this period of organizer 

120
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,399
first of all, I'm going to introduce you our organizer at

121
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,600
Kelompok Linux Arek Suroboyo (KLAS)

122
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,680
first is me, I'm the chairman of KLAS

123
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:20,640
and I have some devision that every devision has its own head of devision

124
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,246
the first is Muhammad Nur Arifin, he is the

125
00:11:25,246 --> 00:11:31,360
head of public relations and planning
division and the second is Fadhil Yori Hibatullah

126
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:38,160
he is the head of research and development devision
and the third is Muhammad Irvan Fanani as 

127
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,079
head of design
and also we have miss Indita Fania as

128
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,650
secretarial and treasury

129
00:11:45,056 --> 00:11:52,720
every devision have its own members
like Nur Arifin has Alif & Toriq as its members

130
00:11:52,720 --> 00:12:01,600
Fadhil has
[mentioning names]

131
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,399
as his members.
most of us are still on probation

132
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:13,120
right know except me, Arifin, Fadhil and Fanani

133
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,200
OK
next is

134
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:23,360
I'm going to talk about our public services

135
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,760
first we have Buaya mirror that means

136
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,200
Buaya repository server
this is our own server

137
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,279
that has been serving public since 2007

138
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,800
and it has been serving more than

139
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,920
9 linux  distros and server repositories

140
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,440
and also we have on-premise dedicated
server in Surabaya

141
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,360
the details about this public service will be presented

142
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,079
further more by Fadhil later in this presentation

143
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,070
next is

144
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:04,959
this is our newest public service 

145
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,079
that we've just built

146
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:14,160
it is a "KLAS" link shortener
it was developed in 2008

147
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,680
but since the first launch until today

148
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,360
it has big impact for the society for the public

149
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:34,853
because just for 3 years,
this service has been shortened for more than 1500 links

150
00:13:34,853 --> 00:13:39,040
for community, public services, 

151
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,839
students, around Surabaya and Indonesia.
so it is quite big impact for us to know

152
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,839
just for 3 years since the first time it has been developed

153
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:57,199
this is one of the most impactful

154
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:02,959
services in KLAS.
this is a #cangkrukanklas

155
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,839
#cangkrukanklas is a Surabaya javanese language that means hang out

156
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,959
so, cangkrukanklas means hang out with

157
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:17,160
friends, talking about knowledge with us,
with KLAS

158
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,120
we have been holding cangkukanklas since 2003 until today

159
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,680
and we have reach many fields of knowledge from desain open source linux

160
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,519
iot infrastructure networking etc

161
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,880
we are also doing #cangkrukanklas offline

162
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,839
by default it was offline but

163
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:46,480
since this pandemic era, we moved all the event to online 

164
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,760
so you can see since the oldest event on the top left

165
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,600
it was held in 2005, until today the bottom left

166
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,680
it was held in 2021, so this is quite new for us

167
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,600
it was held in July

168
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:16,560
beside cangkrukanklas, KLAS is also holding conferences

169
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,199
you can see this is our posters that

170
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,800
we've been organized or we've been collaborated

171
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,160
on the top left, it was me

172
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,600
who was the speaker at
OpenSUSE Asia Summit 2019

173
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,759
at that time, I was talking about
minimizing international internet

174
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,639
traffic usage from interacting devices
using local server on opencif with

175
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,720
application
and we are also in collaboration with

176
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,839
Indonesia Open Infra Day
which is OpenStack Indonesia

177
00:15:52,839 --> 00:16:00,220
to organize the event in Surabaya 2019

178
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:06,097
and today, today's event which is
UbuCon Asia

179
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,720
we are collaborating with UbuCon as community partner,
and also we have

180
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,000

182
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,560
as organizer

183
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,800
this survey has been held on 2008 - 2012 

184
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,639
for the KLAS event, cangkrukanklas etc

185
00:16:50,639 --> 00:17:01,631
there's more than 20 topics on 50 events has been held by KLAS just in 4 years

186
00:17:01,631 --> 00:17:04,640
that is quite big for us you know

187
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:13,132
like once a month
so this is quite big for us at that time

188
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,959
so, that's all from me

189
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,360
the next presentation will be presented by

190
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,039
Fadhil, please take your time

191
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,454
OK thank you Andika

192
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,720
today I would like to introduce you about Buaya

193
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,480
oke
we start from the history

194
00:17:52,120 --> 00:18:05,786
[reading slide]

195
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,600
so buaya was deployed

196
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,760
and maintaned by our friends at KLAS

197
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,720
Buaya was first deployed in 2007 

198
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,600
Buaya if we translate into english is a

199
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,160
"crocodile"
why crocodile?

200
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:41,880
because it comes from the symbol of Surabaya which has a shark and a crocodile

201
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:50,799
in 2007
Buaya still only provide ubuntu repository

202
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:55,360
if we remember it was ubuntu 5.4

203
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,160
which at that time ubuntu 

204
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,760
was hype in Indonesia

205
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,440
then we add more for the other 

206
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,919
distribution, when we got some donation

207
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,919
currently Buaya supports several distribution

208
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,679
we just add AlmaLinux

209
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:30,388
[mentioning the numbers]

210
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,880
this is a list of the maintaners

211
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,320
we can next

212
00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:01,120
the first one we got a support from

213
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,480
Radnext Indonesia to build this service

214
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,080
they support us by giving physical server

215
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,919
with Intel Pentium 2

216
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,200
Buaya was initiated by one of the KLAS organizer

217
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,039
he is pak Budiwijaya
that works at Radnet Digital Indonesia before,

218
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:28,258
he and his colleagues also made logo for Buaya

219
00:20:29,446 --> 00:20:34,773
we can check the logo in the previous slide

220
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:41,200
they also create and maintain a mailing list on Yahoo

221
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,622
and people get connected to us through that mailing list

222
00:20:47,202 --> 00:20:50,400
unfortunately we don't have screenshot

223
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,919
to the mailing list now

224
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,720
so we can't show it

225
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,559
first was maintanied by Budiwijaya from 2007

226
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,880
until 2013

227
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,600
at the time, we use Intel Pentium 2 processor

228
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:21,280
and we also got help from OpenSUSE and OpenBSD community

229
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,640
in the form of hard drives

230
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,400
and Mr. Budiwijaya also told us when he was setting up Buaya in 2018,

231
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,679
he was using [ ... FS]
and several hard drives on several

232
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,520
nodes or computer

233
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,880
after Mr.Budiwijaya, Buaya was maintaned by Mr. Mahyuddin

234
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,559
from 2013 - 2016

235
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,880
and then after 

236
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:02,240
Mr. Mahyuddin
Buaya was done from 2016 - 2017

237
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:10,000
then in 2018, we initialized it again to revive Buaya

238
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,600
by Mr. Darian
and then I joinded KLAS to help

239
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,139
Mr. Darian setting up and maintaining buaya until now

240
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,400
next

241
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:33,919
this is a screenshot from 2010

242
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,493
was taken on 11 February 2010

243
00:22:38,493 --> 00:22:43,280
you can see at the top of the news area 

244
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,760
it is called "Berita Penting" (important information)

245
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:55,273
if there is a status or fix or update regarding the Buaya server, it will post in this section

246
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:02,960
the list of mirror list is also quite much at that time

247
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:13,640
from ubuntu 5.4 until ubuntu 8.4

248
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:20,480
and OpenSuse 10.3

249
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,320
at that time it was pretty cool, quite a lot of people were using 

250
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:32,480
and active in our forums to report us about 

251
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:38,640
something about Buaya, and how to use Buaya like that

252
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,000
next

253
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:51,279
and also we have screenshot in 2014,
we have the same layout 

254
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:55,360
with additional monitoring graph

255
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,360
next
ok, for

256
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,600
current condition

257
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,159
we are using Intel Core 2 Duo
and we have drives with total of

258
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:16,320
8 TB what we configured using LVM

259
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,880
as we know, today there are 6 active mirror in Buaya: ArcLinux,

for Ubuntu and OpenSUSE we are 

262
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:40,159
already in official mirror list
we use R-Sync and

263
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,400
cron to schedule the synchronization

264
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,640
and also we create a simple script from Python

265
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,240
to monitor and report via Telegram

266
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,840

00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:06,159
ftpsync for Debian and Ubuntu
and implement 2-stage sync

268
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,960
for Debian and Ubuntu

269
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,440
