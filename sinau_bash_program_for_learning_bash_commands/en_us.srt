00:00:07,054 --> 00:00:13,026
Let me introduce myself, my name is Kuriyanto. I am from Indonesia.

2
00:00:13,026 --> 00:00:18,895
I am a teacher at SMK (Vocational School) Negeri 1 Kragilan.

3
00:00:18,895 --> 00:00:24,164
Today I will discuss about Sinau-Bash. 

4
00:00:24,164 --> 00:00:32,329
Sinau-Bash is a program used to learn Bash language, 

5
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:38,218
or program for learning Bash command.

6
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:44,432
About Bash

7
00:00:44,432 --> 00:00:58,793
Bash is a shell-based programming language that is installed on Linux and Mac OS by default.

8
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:05,314
Bash itself is developed by the GNU Project and is licensed free.

9
00:01:06,687 --> 00:01:10,626
About Sinau-Bash

10
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:17,994
Sinau-Bash itself is a simple program developed in the Bash language.

11
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:29,841
Sinau in Javanese means learning. If put together Sinau-Bash means learning Bash.

12
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:49,357
Sinau-Bash consists of three levels, the first is the easy level. This easy level when the answer is wrong then the answer will appear.

13
00:01:49,357 --> 00:02:00,556
Level 2 is medium level, at this level if the answer is wrong then there is no correct answer information.

14
00:02:00,556 --> 00:02:22,719
Hard level or difficult level will not show wrong answer information and will display the result when we are completed answering all questions from Sinau-Bash.

15
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:40,724
Sinau-Bash looks more or less like this. For now there are two languages provided, the first is Indonesian, and the second is English.

16
00:02:40,724 --> 00:02:48,269
This is an example when we choose English.

17
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:56,066
You can download it from the address shown here.

18
00:02:56,066 --> 00:03:07,643
I will show you how to download Sinau-Bash, run Sinau-Bash, and learn with Sinau-Bash.

19
00:03:07,643 --> 00:03:20,732
We enter the link at https://github.com/kuriyantoadi/sinau-bash-ubucon.

20
00:03:20,732 --> 00:03:35,533
We can click the code and then download the zip, later when it is downloaded, just look for the folder, there will be an install.sh file.

21
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:43,667
To run this install.sh command we can use the terminal.

22
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:54,234
We can right click here and then Open Terminal in our Sinau-Bash.

23
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,594
It's in the Sinau-Bash folder.

24
00:03:58,594 --> 00:04:12,691
Now that I'm in the Sinau-Bash directory, let's check if we have the install.sh file.

25
00:04:12,691 --> 00:04:25,756
I already have an install.sh file, then we can run it with the command ./install.sh, Enter.

26
00:04:25,756 --> 00:04:35,108
Sinau-Bash looks like this.

27
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:43,446
Please select your language, there are two languages, Indonesian and English.

28
00:04:43,446 --> 00:04:55,905
Initially it was developed only for Indonesian because the first time I made it, it was intended for vocational schools students

29
00:04:55,905 --> 00:05:05,509
who will learn Linux server, so basically you have to learn Sinau-Bash first so you can proceed to learn server.

30
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:08,515
Now I have developed it to include English.

31
00:05:08,515 --> 00:05:16,709
For those of you who are in Asia such as Malaysia, Japan, Korea, China, Pakistan, India, and you want to develop it

32
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:24,581
in the local language of your country, please feel free to email me and contribute to developing Sinau-Bash.

33
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:32,531
I give you an example to enter Sinau-Bash using English, we select 2 (two) then Enter.

34
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:47,783
Here we can write our names as participants. I wrote Kuriyanto, the reason is to try Sinau-Bash.

35
00:05:47,783 --> 00:05:58,210
There are three levels, the first is easy, then medium, and hard.

36
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:11,600
We try easy level, and a question appears like this: "To open a zip file with the command?"

37
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:25,763
And you can write down the answer below. To open a zip file, the command is unzip, press Enter.

38
00:06:25,763 --> 00:06:34,637
If your answer is correct it will say "Your answer is correct", this means we successfully answer the question.

39
00:06:34,637 --> 00:06:45,843
And the next question, "To add a new user with the command ?"

40
00:06:45,843 --> 00:06:54,971
adduser. This is the right one, let's try to enter the wrong answer.

41
00:06:54,971 --> 00:07:07,766
For example, the question is "To enter a directory with the command ?" our answer is "ls" (should be cd or change directory), Enter.

42
00:07:07,766 --> 00:07:16,594
There will be an error message, "Sorry your answer is wrong".

43
00:07:16,594 --> 00:07:22,227
And the correct answer will be shown, the answer is cd or change directory.

44
00:07:22,227 --> 00:07:35,034
Okay, this is easy level of Sinau-Bash. We'll try the medium level at a new tab.

45
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:48,558
We choose 2 and medium, Enter.

46
00:07:48,558 --> 00:08:02,784
The question is "To create a belajar-bash directory you can enter the command ?"

47
00:08:02,784 --> 00:08:14,293
The answer is "mkdir belajar-bash". This is the right answer.

48
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:37,700
The next question is "Command to give full user, group, and other access rights to files ?", the right answer is "chmod 777".

49
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:43,186
But we'll try to answer incorrectly, we will see if there will be an answer or not, we try only "chmod".

50
00:08:43,186 --> 00:08:49,151
The answer is wrong, "Sorry your answer is wrong."

51
00:08:49,151 --> 00:09:03,489
So if the answer is wrong, there will be no correct answer below. Unlike the easy level (easy), the correct answer will be shown.

52
00:09:03,489 --> 00:09:10,374
Next we'll try the hard level.

53
00:09:10,374 --> 00:09:28,813
 

54
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:42,983
We have a server with IP address 10.78.12.1, how to access the server remotely with SSH?

55
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:51,612
The command is "ssh 10.78.12.1".

56
00:09:51,612 --> 00:10:03,682
In the hard level of Sinau-Bash, the answer will not be shown whether it is right or wrong.

57
00:10:03,682 --> 00:10:20,307
And the previous questions will disappear, and the result will be shown later after we finish answering all the questions from Sinau-Bash.

58
00:10:20,307 --> 00:12:14,934
For example, we finish the easy one first.

59
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:18,879
 

60
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:28,997
When finished, the result will appear like this.

61
00:12:28,997 --> 00:12:44,338
I have answered all of the questions in 375 seconds with easy questions and my score is 90.

62
00:12:44,338 --> 00:13:01,009
So we have answered 20 questions, there are 20 questions per level and each question is worth 5 point. I have 2 questions that answered incorrectly.

63
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:14,230
For Sinau-Bash, although the questions are the same, each time the questions will be different because they are randomized.

64
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:26,496
Because the questions are randomized, there are 60 possibilities of randomization, we can repeat the study with Sinau-Bash with a different order of questions,

65
00:13:26,496 --> 00:13:34,997
and it will make our memory of Bash basics more convenient.

66
00:13:34,997 --> 00:13:48,091
 

67
00:13:48,091 --> 00:13:54,300
Any questions so far?

68
00:13:54,300 --> 00:14:10,718
Thank you for watching my material on Sinau-Bash. If you are interested in Sinau-Bash, you can download Sinau-Bash and learn Sinau-Bash. 

69
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:17,141
For those of you who live abroad, especially from Asia, if you want to develop the Sinau-Bash program,

70
00:14:17,141 --> 00:14:31,680
I am open if you want to contribute, develop and provide Sinau-Bash for people to learn. Thank you.
